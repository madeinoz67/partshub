**States**:
- `uploading`: Being stored
- `available`: Ready for download
- `expired`: Past retention period

**Relationships**:

### Status Check
**Purpose**: Required validation that must pass before code can be merged

**Properties**:
- `name`: Check identifier

- `failure`: Validation failed
- `error`: System error occurred

**Relationships**:
- Created by Jobs (N:1)
- Required by Branch Protection (N:M)

### Secret
**Purpose**: Encrypted configuration data needed for deployments and external service access

**Properties**:
- `name`: Secret identifier
- `scope`: Repository, environment, or organization level
- `created_at`: When secret was added
- `updated_at`: Last modification time

**Security Properties**:
- Values are encrypted at rest
- Only accessible during workflow execution
- Audit logging of access
- Environment-based access control

**Relationships**:
- Scoped to Environment (N:1, optional)
- Used by Steps (N:M)

### Release
**Purpose**: Versioned distribution of the application with associated artifacts

**Properties**:
- `tag_name`: Git tag (v1.0.0, v1.0.1, etc.)
- `name`: Release title
- `body`: Release notes content
- `draft`: Whether release is published
- `prerelease`: Beta/alpha indicator
- `created_at`: Release creation time
- `assets`: Attached files and artifacts

**States**:
- `draft`: Being prepared
- `published`: Available to users
- `archived`: Historical record

**Relationships**:
- Triggered by Git Tags (1:1)
- Contains Artifacts (1:N)
- Has Docker Images (1:N)

### Docker Image
**Purpose**: Containerized application build with specific version tags

**Properties**:
- `repository`: Container registry location
- `tags`: Version identifiers (latest, v1.0.0, sha-abc123)
- `digest`: Content hash
- `size`: Image size in bytes
- `created_at`: Build timestamp
- `labels`: Metadata annotations

**Registry Properties**:
- Stored in GitHub Container Registry (ghcr.io)
- Automatically tagged with version and SHA
- Cleanup policies for old images

**Relationships**:
- Built by Release Workflow (N:1)
- Tagged with Version (N:1)

## Data Flow Patterns

### CI Workflow Data Flow
```
Push Event → Workflow Trigger → Jobs Execute → Status Checks Created → Artifacts Stored
```

### CD Workflow Data Flow
```
Merge Event → Deployment Job → Environment Update → Status Notification
```

### Release Workflow Data Flow
```
Tag Creation → Release Object → Artifact Generation → Docker Build → Registry Push
```

## Validation Rules

### Workflow Validation
- Must have at least one job
- Job dependencies cannot be circular
- Required secrets must exist in target environment

### Job Validation
- Steps must be ordered array
- Environment references must exist
- Runner specification must be valid

### Secret Validation
- Names must be valid identifiers
- Environment scoping must be consistent
- Access permissions must be appropriate

### Release Validation
- Tag names must follow semantic versioning
- Release notes must be generated from commits
- Docker tags must match release version

## State Transitions

### Workflow Execution States
```
queued → in_progress → (completed | failed | cancelled)
```

### Job Execution States
```
pending → running → (success | failure | skipped)
```

### Environment States
```
available ↔ protected ↔ unavailable
```

### Artifact Lifecycle
```
uploading → available → expired
```

This data model provides the foundation for understanding how GitHub workflows, jobs, and related entities interact to implement the CI/CD automation requirements.
