# Research: GitHub Workflows for CI/CD

## Technology Decisions

### GitHub Actions Platform
**Decision**: Use GitHub Actions as the CI/CD platform
**Rationale**:
- Native integration with GitHub repository
- Free tier includes 2000 minutes/month for private repos
- Extensive marketplace of pre-built actions
- Built-in secret management and environment variables
- Matrix builds for multiple configurations

**Alternatives considered**:
- Jenkins: Requires self-hosting and maintenance overhead
- CircleCI: Additional cost and complexity for GitHub integration
- GitLab CI: Would require repository migration

### Workflow Structure Pattern
**Decision**: Multiple specialized workflow files instead of monolithic approach
**Rationale**:
- Separation of concerns (CI, CD, Release, Documentation)
- Independent execution and debugging
- Granular permissions and secrets management
- Easier maintenance and updates

**Alternatives considered**:
- Single mega-workflow: Would be complex and harder to debug
- Per-service workflows: Would create duplication and sync issues

### Container Strategy
**Decision**: Use GitHub Container Registry (ghcr.io) for Docker images
**Rationale**:
- Integrated with GitHub authentication and permissions
- No additional account setup required
- Automatic cleanup policies available
- Free for public repositories

**Alternatives considered**:
- Docker Hub: Rate limiting and account management complexity
- AWS ECR: Additional cloud provider dependency
- Self-hosted registry: Infrastructure overhead

### Version Management Approach
**Decision**: pyproject.toml as single source of truth for versioning
**Rationale**:
- Already established in project structure
- Python ecosystem standard
- Can be automatically synchronized to package.json and other files
- Supports semantic versioning

**Alternatives considered**:
- Git tags only: Would require manual synchronization
- package.json: Would create frontend bias
- Separate VERSION file: Additional file to maintain

### Documentation Build System
**Decision**: MkDocs with automated GitHub Pages deployment
**Rationale**:
- Already used in project (mkdocs.yml exists)
- Simple markdown-based authoring
- GitHub Pages integration available
- Supports versioned documentation

**Alternatives considered**:
- Sphinx: More complex setup and Python-specific
- GitBook: External service dependency
- Custom static site: Development overhead

### Testing Strategy in Workflows
**Decision**: Parallel execution of frontend and backend tests with dependencies
**Rationale**:
- Faster overall execution time
- Independent failure isolation
- Can use matrix strategy for multiple Python/Node versions
- Caching strategies can be optimized per stack

**Alternatives considered**:
- Sequential execution: Slower total time
- Separate workflows: Would complicate PR status checks

### Security and Secrets Management
**Decision**: GitHub Secrets with environment-specific protection rules
**Rationale**:
- Built-in encryption and access control
- Environment-specific secrets for production protection
- Audit logging included
- Integration with OIDC for cloud providers

**Alternatives considered**:
- External secret management: Additional complexity
- Repository variables: Less secure for sensitive data

### Deployment Strategy
**Decision**: Direct deployment to production from main branch
**Rationale**:
- Simplified workflow matching team decision
- Faster delivery cycle
- Comprehensive testing in PR workflow provides safety
- Manual approval gates can be added if needed

**Alternatives considered**:
- Staging environment: Additional infrastructure complexity
- Feature flags: Could be added later if needed

## Implementation Patterns

### Workflow Organization
```
.github/workflows/
├── ci.yml           # Pull request testing and validation
├── cd.yml           # Continuous deployment to production
├── release.yml      # Release automation and artifact creation
└── docs.yml         # Documentation building and deployment
```

### Caching Strategy
- **Node.js dependencies**: Cache node_modules with package-lock.json hash
- **Python dependencies**: Cache uv cache with pyproject.toml + uv.lock hash
- **Docker layers**: Use BuildKit cache mounts and registry cache

### Status Check Requirements
- All CI tests must pass
- Code quality checks (linting, type checking)
- Security scans pass
- Docker build succeeds

### Artifact Management
- **Build artifacts**: Store for 30 days for debugging
- **Test results**: JUnit XML for GitHub integration
- **Docker images**: Tag with git SHA and semantic version
- **Documentation**: Deploy to GitHub Pages with version prefix

## Integration Points

### Existing Project Structure
- Respects current `backend/` and `frontend/` organization
- Integrates with existing `pyproject.toml` and `package.json`
- Uses current testing setup (`pytest`, `npm test`)
- Leverages existing linting configuration (`ruff`)

### External Services
- **GitHub Container Registry**: For Docker image storage
- **GitHub Pages**: For documentation hosting
- **GitHub Releases**: For release artifact distribution

### Monitoring and Observability
- Workflow execution time tracking
- Build failure notifications via GitHub PR comments
- Deployment success/failure reporting
- Security scan result integration

## Performance Considerations

### Optimization Strategies
- Parallel job execution where possible
- Aggressive caching of dependencies
- Docker multi-stage builds for smaller images
- Conditional job execution based on changed files

### Resource Limits
- Keep individual jobs under 6 hours GitHub limit
- Optimize for free tier GitHub Actions minutes
- Use matrix strategies efficiently

### Scaling Considerations
- Self-hosted runners can be added if needed
- Workflow concurrency can be controlled
- Large file handling with Git LFS if required
