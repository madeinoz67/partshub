# Tasks: GitHub Workflows for CI/CD

**Input**: Design documents from `/Users/seaton/Documents/src/partshub/specs/002-github-workflows/`
**Prerequisites**: plan.md (required), research.md, data-model.md, contracts/

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Load plan.md from feature directory
   → Extract: GitHub Actions, Docker, MkDocs tech stack
2. Load design documents:
   → contracts/: ci-workflow-contract.yml, cd-workflow-contract.yml, release-workflow-contract.yml
   → quickstart.md: Integration test scenarios for each workflow
   → research.md: Technology decisions for workflow implementation
3. Generate tasks by category:
   → Setup: GitHub Actions environment, secrets, repository settings
   → Tests: workflow contract validation tests, integration scenario tests
   → Core: GitHub workflow YAML files implementation
   → Integration: workflow dependencies, trigger validation, artifact handling
   → Polish: documentation, performance optimization, monitoring
4. Apply task rules:
   → Different workflow files = mark [P] for parallel
   → Same workflow file = sequential (no [P])
   → Contract tests before implementation (TDD)
5. Number tasks sequentially (T001, T002...)
```

## Format: `[ID] [P?] Description`
- **[P]**: Can run in parallel (different files, no dependencies)
- Include exact file paths in descriptions

## Path Conventions
- **GitHub Workflows**: `.github/workflows/` at repository root
- **Tests**: `tests/workflows/` for workflow validation
- **Documentation**: Update existing docs in `docs/` directory

## Phase 3.1: Setup
- [x] T001 Create .github/workflows directory and basic repository structure
- [x] T002 [P] Configure repository settings for GitHub Actions (branch protection, secrets access)
- [x] T003 [P] Set up workflow testing environment with act or GitHub CLI tools

## Phase 3.2: Tests First (TDD) ⚠️ MUST COMPLETE BEFORE 3.3
**CRITICAL: These tests MUST be written and MUST FAIL before ANY workflow implementation**

### Contract Validation Tests
- [x] T004 [P] CI workflow contract validation test in tests/workflows/test_ci_contract.py
- [x] T005 [P] CD workflow contract validation test in tests/workflows/test_cd_contract.py
- [x] T006 [P] Release workflow contract validation test in tests/workflows/test_release_contract.py (simplified)

### Integration Scenario Tests
- [x] T007 [P] Test scenario: Push to feature branch triggers CI in tests/workflows/test_ci_integration.py (simplified)
- [x] T008 [P] Test scenario: PR creation requires status checks in tests/workflows/test_pr_protection.py (simplified)
- [x] T009 [P] Test scenario: Main branch push triggers deployment in tests/workflows/test_cd_integration.py (simplified)
- [x] T010 [P] Test scenario: Release tag triggers release workflow in tests/workflows/test_release_integration.py (simplified)
- [x] T011 [P] Test scenario: Manual workflow trigger works in tests/workflows/test_manual_triggers.py (simplified)

### Performance and Security Tests
- [x] T012 [P] Workflow performance validation (<10min execution) in tests/workflows/test_performance.py (simplified)
- [x] T013 [P] Security validation (no secrets in logs) in tests/workflows/test_security.py (simplified)

## Phase 3.3: Core Implementation (ONLY after tests are failing)

### GitHub Workflow Files
- [x] T014 [P] CI workflow implementation in .github/workflows/ci.yml
- [x] T015 [P] CD workflow implementation in .github/workflows/cd.yml
- [x] T016 [P] Release workflow implementation in .github/workflows/release.yml

### Workflow Components and Actions
- [x] T017 [P] Backend testing job configuration (pytest, ruff, security scan)
- [x] T018 [P] Frontend testing job configuration (npm test, linting, build validation)
- [x] T019 [P] Docker build and validation job configuration
- [x] T020 [P] Documentation build job configuration (MkDocs)
- [x] T021 Version synchronization script (pyproject.toml to package.json) in scripts/sync-versions.sh
- [x] T022 [P] Release notes generation script in scripts/generate-release-notes.sh
- [x] T023 [P] Docker image tagging and push logic

## Phase 3.4: Integration

### Workflow Dependencies and Triggers
- [x] T024 Configure CI workflow triggers (push, pull_request) with proper branch filters
- [x] T025 Configure CD workflow dependencies on CI workflow success
- [x] T026 Configure release workflow triggers (tag creation) with semantic version validation
- [x] T027 Set up workflow environment variables and secrets management

### Artifact and Cache Management
- [x] T028 [P] Configure dependency caching (Node.js, Python, Docker layers)
- [x] T029 [P] Configure test result artifacts and JUnit XML reporting
- [x] T030 [P] Configure build artifact storage and retention policies
- [x] T031 [P] Configure Docker image registry integration (GitHub Container Registry)

### Status Checks and Branch Protection
- [x] T032 Configure required status checks for pull request protection
- [x] T033 Configure deployment environment protection rules
- [x] T034 Set up stakeholder notification system (GitHub comments/issues)

## Phase 3.5: Polish

### Documentation and Monitoring
- [x] T035 [P] Update README.md with workflow documentation and badge status
- [x] T036 [P] Create workflow troubleshooting guide in docs/workflows/troubleshooting.md
- [x] T037 [P] Add workflow performance monitoring and alerting
- [x] T038 [P] Create developer workflow guide in docs/workflows/developer-guide.md

### Optimization and Validation
- [x] T039 Optimize workflow execution times and resource usage
- [x] T040 Validate all quickstart.md test scenarios work end-to-end
- [x] T041 Perform security audit of workflow configurations and secrets
- [x] T042 Run complete workflow integration testing with real repository
