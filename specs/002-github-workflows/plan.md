# Implementation Plan: GitHub Workflows for CI/CD

**Branch**: `002-github-workflows` | **Date**: 2025-09-28 | **Spec**: [spec.md](./spec.md)
**Input**: Feature specification from `/Users/seaton/Documents/src/partshub/specs/002-github-workflows/spec.md`

## Execution Flow (/plan command scope)
```
1. Load feature spec from Input path
   → If not found: ERROR "No feature spec at {path}"
2. Fill Technical Context (scan for NEEDS CLARIFICATION)
   → Detect Project Type from context (web=frontend+backend, mobile=app+api)
   → Set Structure Decision based on project type
3. Fill the Constitution Check section based on the content of the constitution document.
4. Evaluate Constitution Check section below
   → If violations exist: Document in Complexity Tracking
   → If no justification possible: ERROR "Simplify approach first"
   → Update Progress Tracking: Initial Constitution Check
5. Execute Phase 0 → research.md
   → If NEEDS CLARIFICATION remain: ERROR "Resolve unknowns"
6. Execute Phase 1 → contracts, data-model.md, quickstart.md, agent-specific template file (e.g., `CLAUDE.md` for Claude Code, `.github/copilot-instructions.md` for GitHub Copilot, `GEMINI.md` for Gemini CLI, `QWEN.md` for Qwen Code or `AGENTS.md` for opencode).
7. Re-evaluate Constitution Check section
   → If new violations: Refactor design, return to Phase 1
   → Update Progress Tracking: Post-Design Constitution Check
8. Plan Phase 2 → Describe task generation approach (DO NOT create tasks.md)
9. STOP - Ready for /tasks command
```

**IMPORTANT**: The /plan command STOPS at step 7. Phases 2-4 are executed by other commands:
- Phase 2: /tasks command creates tasks.md
- Phase 3-4: Implementation execution (manual or via tools)

## Summary
Implement automated GitHub workflows for CI/CD that ensure code quality, automate testing, deploy to production, build documentation, manage releases, and publish Docker images. The system must support the full development lifecycle from feature branches through production deployment with comprehensive automation and quality gates.

## Technical Context
**Language/Version**: YAML (GitHub Actions), Shell scripting, Python 3.11+ (for tooling)  
**Primary Dependencies**: GitHub Actions, Docker, MkDocs, pytest, ruff, uv, Node.js/npm  
**Storage**: GitHub Container Registry, GitHub Artifacts, GitHub Pages  
**Testing**: pytest (backend), npm test (frontend), integration tests, workflow validation  
**Target Platform**: GitHub Actions runners (Ubuntu latest), production deployment environment
**Project Type**: web (existing frontend + backend structure)  
**Performance Goals**: Workflow execution <10 minutes, Docker builds <5 minutes, test suite <3 minutes  
**Constraints**: Free GitHub Actions minutes, no external secrets in workflow files, production deployment safety  
**Scale/Scope**: Single repository, multiple workflows (CI, CD, release), support for concurrent development

## Constitution Check
*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

**Constitutional Requirements Assessment:**

✅ **I. Specification-Driven Development**: Complete feature specification exists with clear user scenarios and functional requirements
✅ **II. Test-Driven Development**: Workflow tests will be written before implementation; CI/CD workflows will enforce TDD for application code
✅ **III. Incremental Design & Planning**: Following systematic phases: Research → Design → Contracts → Task Generation
✅ **IV. Library-First Architecture**: GitHub Actions workflow files will be modular and reusable; workflow libraries can be shared
✅ **V. CLI-Centric Interface**: All automation will be CLI-driven through GitHub Actions and shell scripts
✅ **VI. Testing Isolation**: Workflow tests will use separate test environments; no interference with production systems

**Quality Standards Compliance:**
✅ **Code Quality**: Workflows will enforce linting, type checking, and automated tests
✅ **Security**: No secrets in repository; proper secret management through GitHub secrets
✅ **Documentation**: All workflows will be documented with examples
✅ **CI/CD Integration**: This feature IS the CI/CD integration system

**RESULT: PASS** - No constitutional violations identified

# Option 2: Web application (when "frontend" + "backend" detected)

```

**Structure Decision**: Option 2 (Web application) - Project has existing frontend/ and backend/ directories with established structure

**GitHub Workflows Location**: `.github/workflows/` (standard GitHub Actions location)

## Phase 0: Outline & Research
1. **Extract unknowns from Technical Context** above:
   - For each NEEDS CLARIFICATION → research task
   - For each dependency → best practices task
   - For each integration → patterns task

2. **Generate and dispatch research agents**:
   ```
   For each unknown in Technical Context:
     Task: "Research {unknown} for {feature context}"
   For each technology choice:
     Task: "Find best practices for {tech} in {domain}"
   ```

3. **Consolidate findings** in `research.md` using format:
   - Decision: [what was chosen]
   - Rationale: [why chosen]
   - Alternatives considered: [what else evaluated]

**Output**: research.md with all NEEDS CLARIFICATION resolved

## Phase 1: Design & Contracts
*Prerequisites: research.md complete*

1. **Extract entities from feature spec** → `data-model.md`:
   - Entity name, fields, relationships
   - Validation rules from requirements
   - State transitions if applicable

2. **Generate API contracts** from functional requirements:
   - For each user action → endpoint
   - Use standard REST/GraphQL patterns
   - Output OpenAPI/GraphQL schema to `/contracts/`

3. **Generate contract tests** from contracts:
   - One test file per endpoint
   - Assert request/response schemas
   - Tests must fail (no implementation yet)

4. **Extract test scenarios** from user stories:
   - Each story → integration test scenario
   - Quickstart test = story validation steps

5. **Update agent file incrementally** (O(1) operation):
   - Run `.specify/scripts/bash/update-agent-context.sh claude`
     **IMPORTANT**: Execute it exactly as specified above. Do not add or remove any arguments.
   - If exists: Add only NEW tech from current plan
   - Preserve manual additions between markers
   - Update recent changes (keep last 3)
   - Keep under 150 lines for token efficiency
   - Output to repository root

**Output**: data-model.md, /contracts/*, failing tests, quickstart.md, agent-specific file

## Phase 2: Task Planning Approach
*This section describes what the /tasks command will do - DO NOT execute during /plan*

**Task Generation Strategy**:
- Load `.specify/templates/tasks-template.md` as base
- Generate tasks from workflow contracts (ci-workflow-contract.yml, cd-workflow-contract.yml, release-workflow-contract.yml)
- Each contract becomes a workflow implementation task
- Contract validation points become test tasks
- Quickstart scenarios become integration test tasks

**Workflow-Specific Task Categories**:
1. **Setup Tasks**: GitHub Actions environment, secrets configuration, repository settings
2. **Contract Test Tasks**: Validate each workflow contract requirement [P]
3. **Workflow Implementation Tasks**: Create .github/workflows/*.yml files [P]
4. **Integration Test Tasks**: End-to-end workflow validation scenarios
5. **Documentation Tasks**: Update project documentation with workflow information

**Ordering Strategy**:
- TDD order: Contract tests before workflow implementation
- Parallel workflow creation: CI, CD, and Release workflows can be built simultaneously [P]
- Sequential integration: Integration tests after all workflows complete
- Documentation: Final task after all implementation complete

**Dependency Mapping**:
- CI workflow contract tests → CI workflow implementation
- CD workflow contract tests → CD workflow implementation
- Release workflow contract tests → Release workflow implementation
- All workflow implementations → Integration testing
- Integration testing → Documentation updates

**Estimated Output**: 20-25 numbered, ordered tasks in tasks.md

**IMPORTANT**: This phase is executed by the /tasks command, NOT by /plan

## Phase 3+: Future Implementation
*These phases are beyond the scope of the /plan command*

**Phase 3**: Task execution (/tasks command creates tasks.md)  
**Phase 4**: Implementation (execute tasks.md following constitutional principles)  
**Phase 5**: Validation (run tests, execute quickstart.md, performance validation)

## Complexity Tracking
*Fill ONLY if Constitution Check has violations that must be justified*

| Violation | Why Needed | Simpler Alternative Rejected Because |
|-----------|------------|-------------------------------------|
| [e.g., 4th project] | [current need] | [why 3 projects insufficient] |
| [e.g., Repository pattern] | [specific problem] | [why direct DB access insufficient] |

- [x] Phase 0: Research complete (/plan command)
