# Implementation Plan: GitHub Workflows for CI/CD

**Branch**: `002-github-workflows` | **Date**: 2025-09-28 | **Spec**: [spec.md](./spec.md)
**Input**: Feature specification from `/Users/seaton/Documents/src/partshub/specs/002-github-workflows/spec.md`

## Execution Flow (/plan command scope)
```
1. Load feature spec from Input path
   → If not found: ERROR "No feature spec at {path}"
2. Fill Technical Context (scan for NEEDS CLARIFICATION)
   → Detect Project Type from context (web=frontend+backend, mobile=app+api)
   → Set Structure Decision based on project type
3. Fill the Constitution Check section based on the content of the constitution document.
4. Evaluate Constitution Check section below
   → If violations exist: Document in Complexity Tracking
   → If no justification possible: ERROR "Simplify approach first"
   → Update Progress Tracking: Initial Constitution Check
5. Execute Phase 0 → research.md
   → If NEEDS CLARIFICATION remain: ERROR "Resolve unknowns"
6. Execute Phase 1 → contracts, data-model.md, quickstart.md, agent-specific template file (e.g., `CLAUDE.md` for Claude Code, `.github/copilot-instructions.md` for GitHub Copilot, `GEMINI.md` for Gemini CLI, `QWEN.md` for Qwen Code or `AGENTS.md` for opencode).
7. Re-evaluate Constitution Check section
   → If new violations: Refactor design, return to Phase 1
   → Update Progress Tracking: Post-Design Constitution Check
8. Plan Phase 2 → Describe task generation approach (DO NOT create tasks.md)
9. STOP - Ready for /tasks command
```

**IMPORTANT**: The /plan command STOPS at step 7. Phases 2-4 are executed by other commands:
- Phase 2: /tasks command creates tasks.md
- Phase 3-4: Implementation execution (manual or via tools)

## Summary

**Primary Requirement**: Implement comprehensive GitHub Actions workflows to automate the entire software development lifecycle for PartsHub, including continuous integration (CI), continuous deployment (CD), and release management with versioned documentation.

**Technical Approach**: Create three core workflow files (ci.yml, cd.yml, release.yml) that automate testing, quality gates, deployment to production, and release artifact generation. Integrate Mike for versioned documentation, Release Please for automated release management, and GitHub Container Registry for Docker image distribution. Include GitHub templates for consistent issue reporting and pull request management.

## Technical Context
**Language/Version**: GitHub Actions YAML workflows, Python 3.11+ (backend), Node.js 18+ (frontend)
**Primary Dependencies**: GitHub Actions ecosystem, Mike (docs versioning), Release Please (release automation), Docker/GitHub Container Registry
**Storage**: YAML workflow files in `.github/workflows/`, GitHub Container Registry for Docker images
**Testing**: Contract validation tests using pytest, GitHub Actions workflow testing in CI environment
**Target Platform**: GitHub Actions runners (ubuntu-latest), containerized deployment environments
**Project Type**: web (backend + frontend) - determines CI/CD structure
**Performance Goals**: CI runs complete in <10 minutes, Docker builds use effective caching, dependency installation optimized
**Constraints**: GitHub Actions usage limits, workflow complexity manageable, must support main-branch deployment strategy
**Scale/Scope**: 3 core workflows (CI/CD/Release), automated quality gates, versioned documentation, GitHub templates for community

## Constitution Check
*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

**I. Specification-Driven Development**: ✅ PASS
- Complete feature specification exists at spec.md with user scenarios, functional requirements, and acceptance criteria
- Business-focused requirements defined before technical planning

**II. Test-Driven Development**: ✅ PASS
- Will implement contract tests for workflow validation before workflow implementation
- TDD approach: failing tests → implementation → refactor cycle
- Contract tests in tests/workflows/ validate workflow behavior

**III. Incremental Design & Planning**: ✅ PASS
- Following systematic planning phases: Research → Design → Contracts → Task Generation
- Each phase completed before proceeding to next

**IV. Library-First Architecture**: ⚠️ EXCEPTION JUSTIFIED
- GitHub workflows are infrastructure/DevOps configuration, not application libraries
- This is foundational infrastructure that enables library-first development for other features
- Workflows themselves are YAML configuration files, not code libraries

**V. CLI-Centric Interface**: ⚠️ EXCEPTION JUSTIFIED
- GitHub workflows are triggered by Git events (push, PR, tags), not CLI commands
- Workflows do expose CLI-like interfaces via GitHub Actions and workflow dispatch
- This is infrastructure automation, not user-facing functionality

**VI. Testing Isolation**: ✅ PASS
- Contract tests use isolated test fixtures
- Workflows run in isolated GitHub Actions environments
- No shared state between workflow runs

└── [platform-specific structure]
```

**Structure Decision**: [DEFAULT to Option 1 unless Technical Context indicates web/mobile app]

## Phase 0: Outline & Research
1. **Extract unknowns from Technical Context** above:
   - For each NEEDS CLARIFICATION → research task
   - For each dependency → best practices task
   - For each integration → patterns task

2. **Generate and dispatch research agents**:
   ```
   For each unknown in Technical Context:
     Task: "Research {unknown} for {feature context}"
   For each technology choice:
     Task: "Find best practices for {tech} in {domain}"
   ```

3. **Consolidate findings** in `research.md` using format:
   - Decision: [what was chosen]
   - Rationale: [why chosen]
   - Alternatives considered: [what else evaluated]

**Output**: research.md with all NEEDS CLARIFICATION resolved

## Phase 1: Design & Contracts
*Prerequisites: research.md complete*

1. **Extract entities from feature spec** → `data-model.md`:
   - Entity name, fields, relationships
   - Validation rules from requirements
   - State transitions if applicable

2. **Generate API contracts** from functional requirements:
   - For each user action → endpoint
   - Use standard REST/GraphQL patterns
   - Output OpenAPI/GraphQL schema to `/contracts/`

3. **Generate contract tests** from contracts:
   - One test file per endpoint
   - Assert request/response schemas
   - Tests must fail (no implementation yet)

4. **Extract test scenarios** from user stories:
   - Each story → integration test scenario
   - Quickstart test = story validation steps

5. **Update agent file incrementally** (O(1) operation):
   - Run `.specify/scripts/bash/update-agent-context.sh claude`
     **IMPORTANT**: Execute it exactly as specified above. Do not add or remove any arguments.
   - If exists: Add only NEW tech from current plan
   - Preserve manual additions between markers
   - Update recent changes (keep last 3)
   - Keep under 150 lines for token efficiency
   - Output to repository root

**Output**: data-model.md, /contracts/*, failing tests, quickstart.md, agent-specific file

## Phase 2: Task Planning Approach
*This section describes what the /tasks command will do - DO NOT execute during /plan*

**Task Generation Strategy**:
- Load `.specify/templates/tasks-template.md` as base
- Generate contract validation tests for each workflow (CI, CD, Release)
- Create workflow implementation tasks following TDD approach
- Add GitHub template creation tasks (issues, PRs, discussions)
- Include integration and validation tasks

**Specific Task Categories**:
1. **Contract Tests** [P]: CI workflow contract validation, CD workflow contract validation, Release workflow contract validation
2. **Workflow Implementation**: ci.yml creation, cd.yml creation, release.yml creation (following contract tests)
3. **GitHub Templates** [P]: Issue templates, PR template, discussion templates
4. **Integration Tests**: End-to-end workflow testing, quickstart validation
5. **Documentation**: Update project documentation with workflow information

**Ordering Strategy**:
- TDD order: Contract tests before workflow implementation
- Parallel execution where possible: Contract tests can run in parallel [P]
- Sequential for workflows: CI → CD → Release (dependency chain)
- Templates can be created in parallel with workflow implementation

**Estimated Output**: 15-20 numbered, ordered tasks in tasks.md

**IMPORTANT**: This phase is executed by the /tasks command, NOT by /plan

## Phase 3+: Future Implementation
*These phases are beyond the scope of the /plan command*

**Phase 3**: Task execution (/tasks command creates tasks.md)  
**Phase 4**: Implementation (execute tasks.md following constitutional principles)  
**Phase 5**: Validation (run tests, execute quickstart.md, performance validation)

## Complexity Tracking
*Fill ONLY if Constitution Check has violations that must be justified*

| Violation | Why Needed | Simpler Alternative Rejected Because |
|-----------|------------|-------------------------------------|
| Library-First Architecture | GitHub workflows are infrastructure configuration files, not application code libraries | Cannot apply library patterns to YAML workflow configuration; workflows are event-driven automation |
| CLI-Centric Interface | Workflows are triggered by Git events (push, PR, tags) and GitHub UI, not CLI commands | Git events are the natural interface for CI/CD automation; manual CLI triggers would defeat automation purpose |
