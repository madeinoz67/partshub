# Feature Specification: GitHub Workflows for CI/CD

**Feature Branch**: `002-github-workflows`
**Created**: 2025-09-27
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "github workflows"

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Identified: CI/CD automation, GitHub Actions, build/test/deploy
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí Developer workflow automation for PartsHub project
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement must be testable
   ‚Üí Focus on automation and quality gates
6. Identify Key Entities (workflow files, jobs, actions)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí Ensure no implementation details leak through
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT workflows need to accomplish and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (specific GitHub Actions, YAML syntax)
- üë• Written for project stakeholders who need automated quality assurance

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story

As a developer working on the PartsHub project, I need automated workflows that ensure code quality and streamline deployment so that I can focus on feature development while maintaining high standards and reducing manual errors in the release process.

### Acceptance Scenarios

1. **Given** I push code to a feature branch, **When** the push triggers the CI workflow, **Then** automated tests run and provide feedback on code quality
2. **Given** I create a pull request, **When** the PR is opened, **Then** all quality checks must pass before merging is allowed
3. **Given** code is merged to the main branch, **When** the merge completes, **Then** a deployment workflow automatically deploys directly to production
4. **Given** tests fail in the CI pipeline, **When** I check the workflow results, **Then** I can see clear failure reasons and logs to debug issues
5. **Given** I want to release a new version, **When** I create a git tag (v1.0.0, v1.0.1, etc.), **Then** the system automatically builds, tests, and publishes release artifacts
6. **Given** documentation source files are updated, **When** code is merged to main, **Then** updated documentation is automatically built and deployed
7. **Given** a new release is created, **When** the release workflow completes, **Then** versioned documentation is published and accessible at a version-specific URL
8. **Given** version information is updated in pyproject.toml, **When** builds are triggered, **Then** all project components automatically reflect the updated version without manual intervention
9. **Given** a release is created, **When** the release workflow runs, **Then** release notes are automatically generated from commit messages and pull request information
10. **Given** a new release is created, **When** the release workflow completes successfully, **Then** Docker images are built and published to GitHub Container Registry with appropriate version tags

### Edge Cases

- What happens when external dependencies are unavailable during workflow execution?
- How does the system handle workflow failures that occur during deployment?
- What occurs when multiple developers push to the same branch simultaneously?
- How are secrets and sensitive data protected in workflow environments?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: System MUST automatically trigger workflows on code push events to any branch
- **FR-002**: System MUST run comprehensive test suites including unit tests, integration tests, and linting before allowing merges
- **FR-003**: System MUST prevent merging of pull requests until all required status checks pass
- **FR-004**: System MUST automatically deploy successful builds from the main branch directly to production
- **FR-005**: System MUST create release builds when git tags (v1.0.0, v1.0.1, etc.) are manually created
- **FR-006**: System MUST provide clear feedback on workflow status and failure reasons
- **FR-007**: System MUST cache dependencies to improve workflow execution speed
- **FR-008**: System MUST run workflows in isolated environments to prevent interference
- **FR-009**: System MUST support both frontend and backend testing in the same workflow
- **FR-010**: System MUST validate Docker container builds as part of the CI process
- **FR-011**: System MUST perform security scanning on dependencies and code
- **FR-012**: System MUST generate and store build artifacts for successful releases
- **FR-013**: System MUST notify relevant stakeholders of deployment successes and failures via GitHub pull request comments and issue updates
- **FR-014**: System MUST support manual workflow triggers for emergency deployments
- **FR-015**: System MUST maintain workflow execution history and logs for debugging
- **FR-016**: System MUST build and deploy documentation automatically as part of the CI/CD pipeline
- **FR-017**: System MUST publish versioned documentation when releases are created
- **FR-018**: System MUST ensure documentation is accessible and properly versioned for each release
- **FR-019**: System MUST manage version information in pyproject.toml as the single source of truth that is automatically propagated to all components during builds
- **FR-020**: System MUST automatically generate and update release notes when new releases are created
- **FR-021**: System MUST build and publish Docker images to GitHub Container Registry when releases are created

### Key Entities

- **Workflow**: Automated process that executes on specific triggers (push, PR, release)
- **Job**: Individual unit of work within a workflow (test, build, deploy)
- **Environment**: Target deployment destination (production) with specific configuration and secrets
- **Artifact**: Build output that can be stored, downloaded, or deployed (Docker images, compiled assets)
- **Status Check**: Required validation that must pass before code can be merged
- **Secret**: Sensitive configuration data needed for deployments and external service access
- **Documentation**: Technical documentation that is built from source and deployed with version-specific URLs
- **Version Source**: pyproject.toml version field as the single authoritative location for version information that is automatically synchronized across all project components
- **Release Notes**: Automatically generated summary of changes, new features, and fixes included in each release
- **Container Registry**: GitHub Container Registry (ghcr.io) for storing and distributing Docker images with version tags corresponding to releases
