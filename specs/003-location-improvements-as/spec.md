## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story

A user needs to organize their electronic parts storage by creating multiple storage locations with consistent naming patterns. Instead of manually creating each location one-by-one, they can select a layout type (Single, Row, Grid, or 3D Grid) and specify parameters to automatically generate a set of organized, hierarchically-named storage locations.

The user selects "Create Locations", chooses a layout type, configures the naming pattern (prefix, ranges, separators), previews the generated location names, and confirms creation. The system creates all locations with appropriate hierarchy and naming conventions.

### Acceptance Scenarios

1. **Given** user is authenticated and on storage locations page, **When** they click "Create" button, **Then** they see a dialog with tabs for Single/Row/Grid/3D Grid layout types

2. **Given** user selects "Row" layout type, **When** they enter prefix "box1-", choose letters a-f, **Then** they see preview showing "box1-a, box1-b, box1-c, box1-d, box1-e, box1-f" (6 locations)

3. **Given** user selects "Grid" layout type, **When** they configure rows (letters a-f) and columns (numbers 1-5), **Then** they see preview showing first 5 locations and total count (30 locations)

4. **Given** user configures a layout that would create 150 locations, **When** preview is generated, **Then** they see a warning message about creating multiple locations and inability to delete

5. **Given** user has configured a valid layout, **When** they click "Create Locations", **Then** all locations are created with correct naming pattern and appear in the location tree

6. **Given** user enters invalid range (e.g., start letter "z", end letter "a"), **When** preview is generated, **Then** they see a validation error and cannot proceed

7. **Given** user selects "3D Grid" layout, **When** they configure 3 dimensions with separators, **Then** preview shows combined naming pattern (e.g., "box1-a11, box1-a12, ..., box1-f55")

8. **Given** user checks "Mark as single-part only" option, **When** locations are created, **Then** all created locations have this designation

### Edge Cases

- What happens when user tries to create locations with names that already exist?
  - System prevents creation and shows error listing duplicate names

- How does system handle very large batch creation (500+ locations)?
  - System enforces maximum limit and shows error if exceeded

- What happens if user closes dialog during preview loading?
  - Dialog closes, no locations created, no data persisted

- How does system handle zero-padding for numbers (e.g., 01 vs 1)?
  - User has option to enable/disable zero-padding per range

- What happens when parent location is selected for generated locations?
  - All generated locations created as children of specified parent

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: System MUST allow authenticated users to create storage locations using four layout types: Single, Row, Grid, and 3D Grid

- **FR-002**: System MUST support Row layout with prefix and single range (letters a-z or numbers 0-999)

- **FR-003**: System MUST support Grid layout with prefix and two ranges (rows √ó columns) with optional separator

- **FR-004**: System MUST support 3D Grid layout with prefix and three ranges (rows √ó columns √ó depth) with two optional separators

- **FR-005**: System MUST provide real-time preview showing generated location names as user configures layout parameters

- **FR-006**: System MUST validate all layout configurations before allowing creation (valid ranges, no duplicates, within limits)

- **FR-007**: System MUST prevent creation of locations with names that already exist in the system

- **FR-008**: System MUST enforce maximum limit of 500 locations per bulk creation operation

- **FR-009**: System MUST show warning when creating more than 100 locations, reminding user that locations cannot be deleted

- **FR-010**: System MUST support letter ranges (a-z) with optional capitalization

- **FR-011**: System MUST support number ranges (0-999) with optional zero-padding

- **FR-012**: System MUST allow users to specify custom separators between range components (for Grid and 3D Grid)

- **FR-013**: System MUST display preview showing first 5 generated names, ellipsis, last name, and total count

- **FR-014**: System MUST allow users to assign all generated locations to an optional parent location

- **FR-015**: System MUST allow users to mark generated locations as "single-part only" storage

- **FR-016**: System MUST persist layout configuration with each created location for audit purposes

- **FR-017**: System MUST validate that letter ranges use single alphabetic characters only

- **FR-018**: System MUST validate that number ranges use non-negative integers only

- **FR-019**: System MUST validate that start values come before or equal to end values in ranges

- **FR-020**: System MUST prevent row layout from exceeding 1000 locations

- **FR-021**: System MUST assign appropriate location type (bin, drawer, shelf, etc.) to all generated locations

- **FR-022**: System MUST refresh location tree immediately after successful creation

- **FR-023**: System MUST show success notification with count of created locations

- **FR-024**: Anonymous users MUST NOT be able to access location creation functionality (read-only access per tiered access control)

### Key Entities

- **Storage Location**: Physical or logical location where parts are stored; has name, type, hierarchy, parent relationship, and optional description

- **Layout Configuration**: Parameters defining how locations are generated; includes layout type, prefix, range specifications (type, start, end, options), separators, and metadata

- **Single Layout Config**: Simplest layout with just a location name; generates one location

- **Row Layout Config**: One-dimensional layout with prefix and single range (letters or numbers); generates linear sequence of locations

- **Grid Layout Config**: Two-dimensional layout with prefix, row range, column range, and separator; generates matrix of locations

- **3D Grid Layout Config**: Three-dimensional layout with prefix, row range, column range, depth range, and two separators; generates 3D matrix of locations

- **Range Specification**: Defines a dimension in multi-dimensional layouts; includes range type (letters/numbers), start value, end value, capitalization option, zero-padding option

- **Generation Preview**: Temporary representation of what will be created; shows sample names, total count, validation status, and any errors
