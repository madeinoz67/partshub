## Notes

**Test-Driven Development (TDD)**:
- ‚ö†Ô∏è All tests (T010-T033, T044-T047) MUST be written BEFORE implementation
- Tests MUST fail initially (verify with pytest -v)
- Implement code to make tests pass (T034-T054)
- Refactor after tests pass

**Test Isolation (Principle VI)**:
- Each test uses isolated in-memory SQLite database
- Tests MUST be runnable in any order: `pytest --random-order`
- Tests MUST support parallel execution: `pytest -n auto`
- No shared mutable state between tests

**Documentation Review (Principle VII)**:
- OpenAPI specs auto-generated but must be verified (T065)
- README updates required for new feature (T066)
- API documentation must be updated (T067)
- Quickstart scenarios must remain executable (T068)

**File Modification Patterns**:
- [P] tasks = different files, can run in parallel
- No [P] = same file or has dependencies, run sequentially
- Backend and frontend work can overlap after API contracts are defined

**Performance Targets**:
- Preview API: <200ms response time (T058)
- Bulk create API: <2s for 500 locations (T059)
- Test suite: <10 minutes total (parallel execution)

**Commit Strategy**:
- Commit after each task or logical group
- Use conventional commits: `feat:`, `test:`, `docs:`, `refactor:`
- No AI attribution in commit messages (Principle V)

- T078-T081 (unit tests) verify extraction logic
- T082-T084 (integration tests) verify end-to-end code population
- All can run in parallel [P] since they're in different test files

**Implementation Dependencies**:
- T085 must complete before T086 (method used by bulk_create_locations)
- T085-T086 must complete before T082-T084 tests can pass
- T086 must complete before T087-T088 (frontend needs backend data)

**Frontend Dependencies** (Optional):
- T087-T088 can run in parallel [P] (different files)
- T087-T088 depend on T086 (backend must provide location_code data)

**Documentation Dependencies**:
- T089 should complete after T086 (document actual implementation)

## Parallel Execution Examples for Location Code Enhancement

### Batch 1: Contract Tests (All Parallel)
```bash
# Using testing-specialist agent for all contract tests
testing-specialist: "Write contract test for location_codes array in preview response (T075)"
testing-specialist: "Write contract test for location_code field in bulk create response (T076)"
testing-specialist: "Write contract test for location code pattern matching (T077)"
```

### Batch 2: Unit Tests (All Parallel)
```bash
# Using testing-specialist agent for all unit tests
testing-specialist: "Write unit test for _extract_location_code() with simple prefix (T078)"
testing-specialist: "Write unit test for location code extraction with special characters (T079)"
testing-specialist: "Write unit test for location code with capitalization preserved (T080)"
testing-specialist: "Write unit test for location code with zero-padding preserved (T081)"
```

### Batch 3: Integration Tests (All Parallel)
```bash
# Using testing-specialist agent for all integration tests
testing-specialist: "Write integration test for row layout with location codes (T082)"
testing-specialist: "Write integration test for grid layout with location codes (T083)"
testing-specialist: "Write integration test for 3D grid with location codes (T084)"
```

### Batch 4: Implementation (Sequential)
```bash
# Using python-fastapi-architect agent for implementation
python-fastapi-architect: "Implement _extract_location_code() method (T085)"
# WAIT for T085 to complete, THEN:
python-fastapi-architect: "Update bulk_create_locations() to populate location_code (T086)"
```

### Batch 5: Frontend (Optional - Parallel)
```bash
# Using frontend-tdd-specialist agent
frontend-tdd-specialist: "Update LocationPreview to display codes (T087)"
frontend-tdd-specialist: "Add info text about auto-generated codes (T088)"
```

### Batch 6: Documentation
```bash
# Using tech-docs-specialist agent
tech-docs-specialist: "Update README and API docs with location_code examples (T089)"
```

## Enhancement Validation Checklist

After completing T075-T089:
- [ ] All 10 new tests pass (T075-T084)
- [ ] Existing 56 tests still pass (regression check)
- [ ] Test coverage maintained at ‚â•80% (currently 93%)
- [ ] Run `uv run ruff check backend/` (zero errors)
- [ ] Run `uv run ruff format backend/`
- [ ] Parallel test execution works: `pytest -n auto`
- [ ] Random-order test execution works: `pytest --random-order`
- [ ] Manual verification: Create locations and verify location_code populated
- [ ] Documentation updated and accurate

## Enhancement Notes

**Why This Works**:
- `location_code` column already exists (added in earlier migration)
- No database migration needed
- Backward compatible (additive change only)
- Simple string extraction logic (O(1) operation)
- No performance impact

**Testing Strategy**:
- Use specialized agents (`testing-specialist` for tests, `python-fastapi-architect` for implementation)
- Follow strict TDD: Tests first, implementation second
- All tests use in-memory SQLite (maintains Constitution Principle VI)
- Tests verify both API contract and business logic

**Expected Outcomes**:
- Row layout: location_code = single letter/number ("a", "b", "1", "2")
- Grid layout: location_code = "row-col" ("a-1", "b-3")  
- 3D Grid: location_code = "row-col-depth" ("a-1.5", "b-2.3")
- Capitalization preserved: "A" not "a"
- Zero-padding preserved: "01" not "1"

**Commit Strategy for Enhancement**:
- Commit T075-T084 together: "test: add location code generation tests"
- Commit T085-T086 together: "feat: add automatic location code generation"
- Commit T087-T088 together: "feat: display location codes in preview (optional)"
- Commit T089: "docs: update README and API docs with location codes"
