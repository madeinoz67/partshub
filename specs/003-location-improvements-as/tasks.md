## Notes

**Test-Driven Development (TDD)**:
- ‚ö†Ô∏è All tests (T010-T033, T044-T047) MUST be written BEFORE implementation
- Tests MUST fail initially (verify with pytest -v)
- Implement code to make tests pass (T034-T054)
- Refactor after tests pass

**Test Isolation (Principle VI)**:
- Each test uses isolated in-memory SQLite database
- Tests MUST be runnable in any order: `pytest --random-order`
- Tests MUST support parallel execution: `pytest -n auto`
- No shared mutable state between tests

**Documentation Review (Principle VII)**:
- OpenAPI specs auto-generated but must be verified (T065)
- README updates required for new feature (T066)
- API documentation must be updated (T067)
- Quickstart scenarios must remain executable (T068)

**File Modification Patterns**:
- [P] tasks = different files, can run in parallel
- No [P] = same file or has dependencies, run sequentially
- Backend and frontend work can overlap after API contracts are defined

**Performance Targets**:
- Preview API: <200ms response time (T058)
- Bulk create API: <2s for 500 locations (T059)
- Test suite: <10 minutes total (parallel execution)

**Commit Strategy**:
- Commit after each task or logical group
- Use conventional commits: `feat:`, `test:`, `docs:`, `refactor:`
- No AI attribution in commit messages (Principle V)
