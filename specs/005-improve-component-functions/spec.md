## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## Clarifications

### Session 2025-10-04
- Q: When a bulk operation partially fails (e.g., 3 of 5 components successfully updated), how should the system handle this? ‚Üí A: All-or-nothing (rollback) - If any component fails, rollback all changes and report error
- Q: When users select components and then navigate to a different page (e.g., pagination), what should happen to the selection? ‚Üí A: Persist globally - Selection persists across all page navigation until explicitly cleared
- Q: Are there role-based restrictions on who can perform bulk operations on components? ‚Üí A: Role-based (Admin only) - Only Admin users can perform bulk operations
- Q: When no components are selected, should bulk operation controls be disabled or hidden? ‚Üí A: Disabled - Show "Selected..." button but keep it disabled/grayed out
- Q: After successfully completing a bulk operation, what should happen to the component selection? ‚Üí A: Maintain selection - Keep components selected for potential follow-up operations

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
Admin users managing electronic component inventory need to perform the same action on multiple components simultaneously. Rather than editing each component individually, admins can select multiple components from the component view and apply bulk operations such as assigning them to projects, adding or removing tags, updating attributes, or deleting them. This saves time when organizing large inventories or performing cleanup tasks. Selection persists across page navigation until explicitly cleared, and selections are maintained after operations to allow follow-up actions.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** an admin user views a component list with 10+ components, **When** admin selects 5 components using checkboxes and chooses "Assign to Project", **Then** all 5 components are assigned to the selected project, the view reflects the change, and the 5 components remain selected
2. **Given** an admin user has selected 3 components, **When** admin chooses "Add Tags" and enters "resistor, SMD", **Then** both tags are added to all 3 selected components and the selection is maintained
3. **Given** an admin user has selected 8 components, **When** admin chooses "Delete" and confirms the action, **Then** all 8 components are permanently removed from inventory
4. **Given** an admin user has selected components on page 1, **When** admin navigates to page 2, **Then** the selection from page 1 persists and admin can select additional components on page 2
5. **Given** an admin user selects 0 components, **When** viewing the component table, **Then** the "Selected..." button is visible but disabled
6. **Given** an admin user attempts a bulk operation that fails on 1 of 5 components, **When** the operation executes, **Then** all changes are rolled back and a detailed error report is shown

### Edge Cases
- **Partial failure**: All changes are rolled back if any component fails during a bulk operation, and a detailed error report is displayed showing which component(s) caused the failure
- **Non-admin users**: Bulk operation controls are hidden or non-functional for non-admin users (only admin users can access bulk operations)
- **Concurrent modification**: If another user modifies a component while it's selected for a bulk operation, the transaction will fail and all changes are rolled back with an error message indicating the conflict
- **Undo operations**: System does not provide undo for bulk operations (relies on rollback-on-failure for data integrity)
- **Duplicate tags**: When adding a tag that already exists on some selected components, the system applies the tag to components that don't have it and skips components that already have it (idempotent operation)

## User Interface Layout

### Component Table View
The component table view displays a list of electronic parts with the following structure:

**Table Structure**:
- **Selection Column**: Checkbox at the start of each row allowing users to select individual components
- **Part Columns**: Part number, Description, Footprint, Stock, Manufacturer, MPN, and location columns
- **Header Checkbox**: A master checkbox in the table header to select/deselect all visible components

**Above Table Controls**:
- **Selected Button**: A button labeled "Selected..." positioned above the table that opens a dropdown menu when clicked
  - Button displays the count of selected items (e.g., "Rows: 323 selected: 1")
  - Button is always visible but disabled (grayed out) when no components are selected
  - Only enabled when one or more components are selected
  - Only visible/accessible to admin users
  - Dropdown menu contains all available bulk operations

**Bulk Operations Menu** (appears when "Selected..." button is clicked):
- Add/remove tags...
- Add to project...
- Add to meta-part...
- Add to purchase list...
- Set low-stock levels...
- Set part attribution...
- Download as CSV
- Delete...
- Deselect all

### Visual Indicators
- Selected rows should have a visual indicator (e.g., highlighted background, checkmark icon)
- Selection count should be prominently displayed showing "X selected: Y" where X is total rows and Y is selected count
- Selection persists across page navigation (visual indicators remain when returning to a page with selected items)
- Bulk operations button should be visually disabled (grayed out) when no items are selected
- For non-admin users, selection checkboxes and bulk operation controls are not displayed

### Add/Remove Tags Form
When users select the "Add/remove tags..." option, a modal dialog displays with the following sections:

**Dialog Header**:
- Title showing "Add or remove tags (X)" where X is the count of selected components

**Adding Tags Section**:
- Section header: "Adding tags"
- Input field labeled "Tags to be added:" with an edit icon
- User can enter multiple tags (comma-separated or similar input method)

**Removing Tags Section**:
- Section header: "Removing tags"
- Two tag selection areas:
  - "Common tags:" - Shows tags that are common across all selected components (displayed as clickable tag badges)
  - "All tags:" - Shows all tags present on any of the selected components (displayed as clickable tag badges)
- Input field labeled "Tags to be removed:" where selected tags appear
- Users can click tag badges to add them to the removal list

**Preview Section**:
- Section header: "Preview"
- Shows "Preview with resulting tags list:" with a table displaying:
  - Part column (component identifier)
  - Tags (user) column - shows user-added tags
  - Tags (auto) column - shows automatically-generated tags
- Preview updates to show what the tags will look like after the operation

**Action Buttons**:
- "Cancel" button to close the dialog without making changes
- "Add/Remove Tags" button to confirm and execute the bulk tag operation

### Add Parts to Project Form
When users select the "Add to project..." option, a modal dialog displays with the following sections:

**Dialog Header**:
- Title: "Add parts to a project"

**Parts List Section**:
- Section header: "Add the following parts:"
- Table showing selected components with columns:
  - Part column (component identifier)
  - Description column (component description)
  - Quantity column (with +/- controls to adjust quantity)
- Each row displays:
  - Component part number (e.g., "CR2032", "HT7333-A")
  - Full component description
  - Quantity selector with increment/decrement buttons (default: 1)

**Project Selection**:
- Label: "To project:"
- Dropdown menu to select the target project (placeholder: "Choose project...")

**Action Buttons**:
- "Cancel" button to close the dialog without making changes
- "Add" button to confirm and add the selected parts to the chosen project

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Component**: Electronic component in inventory with attributes (tags, project assignment, custom attributes). Multiple components can be selected for bulk operations by admin users.
- **Project**: Container for grouping components. Components can be assigned to projects in bulk.
- **Tag**: Label applied to components for categorization. Tags can be added or removed from multiple components simultaneously. Duplicate tags are handled idempotently.
- **Attribute**: Key-value property of a component. Bulk editing capabilities for attributes are provided through the "Set part attribution" and "Set low-stock levels" operations.
- **Bulk Operation**: An atomic transaction applied to multiple selected components simultaneously (assign to project, add/remove tags, set attribute, delete). All operations are all-or-nothing with automatic rollback on any failure.
- **Selection State**: Persistent state tracking which components are currently selected for bulk operations. Selection persists across all page navigation until explicitly cleared via "Deselect all".
