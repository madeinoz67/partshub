# Feature Specification: Simplified Component Creation Wizard

**Feature Branch**: `007-simplify-component-creation`
**Created**: 2025-10-05
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "simplify component creation; we need to simplify the component creation flow, using a wizard like partsbox, I'd liek to use the provider lcsc when the search for part.  linking a part to the provider, will still download all relevant information and pdfs, images, footprints, etc.  maybe user can select what they wnat or have option at later point to add the additional informaiton, will alo provide a direct link to the providers part by means of a url and web icon, additionally for local creation only when selecting manufacturer or footprint, this can be a live search of existing manufatcurers and footprints in local DB, or user can type new manufacture/footprint and will get given option to add from the live search.  Id like the options like partsbox what to do after initially creating the component, i.e go to the newly created part form, or add stock, or continue to add another part using same process just performed, this will allows simplificatiosn and streamlining the addition of new parts"

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí Input provided: wizard-style component creation with LCSC provider integration

5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement testable and specific
   ‚Üí Marked ambiguous requirements with clarification tags
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
   ‚Üí Provider, ProviderLink, Manufacturer, Footprint, Component, Resource (PDF/image/footprint files)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí WARN "Spec has uncertainties" - 6 [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers present
   ‚Üí No implementation details found
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning after clarifications)
```

## Clarifications

### Session 2025-10-05

- Q: Which user roles should have access to the component creation wizard? ‚Üí A: Only admin users can create components
- Q: When the LCSC API is unavailable or returns no results, what should happen? ‚Üí A: Show error message and allow user to switch to local part creation
- Q: Should the wizard support only LCSC or be designed to support multiple providers in the future? ‚Üí A: Multi-provider design - allow adding providers later
- Q: Should resource downloads (PDFs, images, footprints) happen synchronously or asynchronously? ‚Üí A: Hybrid - critical resources (datasheets) sync, others async
- Q: How should duplicate manufacturers/footprints be detected in live search? ‚Üí A: Fuzzy matching - suggests similar names like "TI" for "Texas Instruments"
- Q: With multiple providers available, should the system search all providers or require user selection? ‚Üí A: User selects provider first (Option B), then searches within that provider

## User Scenarios & Testing

### Primary User Story
As a user creating electronic components in PartsHub, I want a streamlined wizard that lets me search for parts from providers like LCSC, automatically retrieve all relevant technical documentation and resources, and choose my next action after creation‚Äîso I can efficiently add multiple components without repetitive navigation.

### Acceptance Scenarios

1. **Given** I am on the component creation wizard
   **When** I select "Linked part", choose LCSC from the provider list, and search for "STM32F103C8T6"
   **Then** I see search results from LCSC with part details, and can select a part to link

2. **Given** I have selected an LCSC part in the wizard
   **When** I confirm the selection
   **Then** the system downloads the part's datasheet (PDF), images, footprint files, and other metadata, and displays a direct link to the provider's part page

3. **Given** I have created a component via the wizard
   **When** the creation succeeds
   **Then** I am presented with three options: "Go to created part", "Add stock for created part", or "Stay and continue creating new parts"

4. **Given** I am creating a local (non-linked) part in the wizard
   **When** I start typing in the "Manufacturer" field
   **Then** I see live search suggestions from existing manufacturers in the database, plus an option to create a new manufacturer if my input doesn't match

5. **Given** I am creating a local part and enter a new manufacturer name
   **When** I submit the form
   **Then** the new manufacturer is created and associated with my component

6. **Given** I have downloaded resources from LCSC for a linked part
   **When** I view the component details
   **Then** I see a web icon link that opens the provider's part page in a new tab

7. **Given** I am in the wizard and have selected some resources to download
   **When** I choose to download only selected resources
   **Then** only those resources are retrieved, and I can add the remaining resources later

### Edge Cases

- What happens when LCSC search returns no results for a query? System displays "No results found" message and offers option to create local part instead
- How does the system handle network timeouts during resource downloads?
- What if a user tries to create a duplicate component with the same manufacturer part number?
- How should the system respond if downloaded resources are corrupted or invalid file types?
- What happens if a user navigates away mid-wizard? Should progress be saved?
- How are very large result sets from LCSC handled (pagination, limits)?
- What if the user's input for manufacturer/footprint is extremely long or contains invalid characters? System validates against 255 character limit and allows only alphanumeric, hyphens, spaces, periods, underscores; displays validation error for invalid input
- How should the wizard behave when only one provider (LCSC) is configured? Provider should be automatically pre-selected to avoid unnecessary selection step

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: System MUST provide a wizard interface for creating components with step-by-step guidance
- **FR-002**: System MUST support searching for parts from the LCSC provider within the wizard
- **FR-003**: System MUST display search results from LCSC with part metadata (name, description, manufacturer, part number, etc.)
- **FR-004**: System MUST allow users to select a part from LCSC search results to link to their component
- **FR-005**: System MUST download datasheets (PDFs), images, footprint files, and other available resources when linking an LCSC part
- **FR-006**: System MUST allow users to selectively choose which resources to download immediately, with an option to add remaining resources later
- **FR-007**: System MUST create a persistent link to the provider's part page and display it with a web icon on the component details
- **FR-008**: System MUST provide live search suggestions for manufacturers from the local database when creating local parts
- **FR-009**: System MUST provide live search suggestions for footprints from the local database when creating local parts
- **FR-010**: System MUST allow users to create new manufacturers by typing a new name in the manufacturer field during local part creation
- **FR-011**: System MUST allow users to create new footprints by typing a new name in the footprint field during local part creation
- **FR-012**: System MUST present three post-creation options: "Go to created part form", "Add stock for created part", "Stay and continue creating new parts"
- **FR-013**: System MUST navigate to the appropriate page based on the user's post-creation option selection
- **FR-014**: When "Stay and continue" is selected, system MUST reset the wizard to allow creating another part using the same flow
- **FR-015**: System MUST distinguish between "Linked parts" (from providers) and "Local parts" (manually created) in the wizard
- **FR-016**: System MUST validate that linked parts have valid provider references and metadata
- **FR-017**: System MUST handle LCSC API failures gracefully by displaying an error message and allowing users to switch to local part creation mode
- **FR-018**: System MUST restrict wizard access to admin users only; non-admin users cannot access component creation wizard
- **FR-019**: System MUST be designed to support multiple part providers through a standardized interface, with LCSC as the initial implementation; new providers must be addable without modifying existing provider code (e.g., adapter pattern)
- **FR-020**: System MUST download critical resources (datasheets/PDFs) synchronously before component creation completes; non-critical resources (images, footprint files) MUST download asynchronously in the background with progress indicators
- **FR-021**: System MUST use fuzzy matching for manufacturer and footprint live search to detect and suggest similar existing entries (e.g., "TI" suggests "Texas Instruments"); suggestions must be ranked by relevance
- **FR-022**: System MUST validate manufacturer and footprint names with maximum length of 255 characters, allow alphanumeric characters plus hyphens, spaces, periods, and underscores; names must be unique (case-insensitive comparison)
- **FR-023**: System MUST require users to select a provider before searching when linked part mode is chosen; when only one provider is configured, it must be pre-selected automatically to streamline the workflow

### Key Entities

- **Provider**: Represents external part data sources (e.g., LCSC). Has a name, API endpoint reference, and status
- **ProviderLink**: Links a component to a provider's part. Contains provider ID, provider part number, provider part URL, and sync status
- **Component**: Electronic part being created. Has name, description, manufacturer reference, footprint reference, and optional provider link
- **Manufacturer**: Company that produces components. Has name and can be created during wizard flow
- **Footprint**: Physical layout/mounting pattern for components. Has name and can be created during wizard flow
- **Resource**: Downloadable files associated with components (datasheets, images, footprint files). Has type, file path, URL, and relationship to component
