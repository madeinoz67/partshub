# Feature Specification: Stock Management Operations

**Feature Branch**: `006-add-remove-stock`
**Created**: 2025-10-04
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "add remove stock; implement the add, remove and move stock from the componet row expansion menu. stock will be added as per the dialog thats opened, removing stokc is alot simpler.  moving stock will allow movemnet betwen the current selected lcoaiton and another that already has the comonents, or a completely new location"

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Identified: Add Stock, Remove Stock, Move Stock operations from component row expansion menu
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: What validation rules apply when removing more stock than available?]
   ‚Üí [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: Should moving stock support partial quantities or only entire stock amounts?]
   ‚Üí [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: What happens to pricing/lot information when moving stock?]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí User flow clear from screenshots and description
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement must be testable
6. Identify Key Entities
   ‚Üí Stock entries, locations, components
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí WARN "Spec has uncertainties - see clarifications"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

## Clarifications

### Session 2025-10-04
- Q: Should the system log all stock operations (add/remove/move) in a permanent history that users can view? ‚Üí A: Yes - Track all operations with timestamp, user, operation type, quantities (with +/- indicators), location, lot ID, price, and comments (matching existing stock history implementation)
- Q: Who should be allowed to perform stock operations (add, remove, move)? ‚Üí A: Admin users only - stock operations are CRUD operations requiring admin privileges
- Q: When a user attempts to remove more stock than available at a location, what should happen? ‚Üí A: Auto-adjust - Automatically cap removal at available quantity
- Q: When stock is moved between locations, what should happen to pricing and lot information? ‚Üí A: Preserve all - Copy pricing and lot data to destination location
- Q: How should the system handle concurrent stock modifications when multiple admins modify the same component/location simultaneously? ‚Üí A: Pessimistic locking - Lock location during operation, block others
- Q: Where should stock operation forms display? ‚Üí A: Forms must open inline within the expanded component row, not as modal dialogs or separate pages. Multiple rows can have forms open simultaneously, with each operation scoped to its respective component.

## User Scenarios & Testing

### Primary User Story
Admin users need to manage component stock across different storage locations by adding new stock (with pricing and lot information), removing stock when components are used or discarded, and moving stock between locations to reorganize inventory.

### Acceptance Scenarios

**Add Stock**
1. **Given** a component row is expanded, **When** user selects "Add Stock" from the row expansion menu, **Then** system displays a multi-step form inline within the expanded row with quantity/pricing and storage location options
2. **Given** user is on "Enter manually" tab in the inline form, **When** user enters quantity and pricing (per component or entire lot), **Then** system calculates and displays total lot price
3. **Given** user completes quantity/pricing step, **When** user selects or creates a storage location, **Then** system adds stock entry with all provided information
4. **Given** user is on "Receive against an order" tab, **When** user selects an order, **Then** system pre-fills quantity and pricing from order details
5. **Given** user completes add stock workflow, **When** stock is successfully added, **Then** system updates component's total quantity and displays success confirmation
6. **Given** multiple component rows are expanded with add stock forms open, **When** user submits a form, **Then** system applies the operation only to the component associated with that specific row

**Remove Stock**
1. **Given** a component row is expanded and has stock in one or more locations, **When** user selects "Remove Stock" from the row expansion menu, **Then** system displays a simple form inline within the expanded row showing available locations with quantities
2. **Given** remove stock form is open in the expanded row, **When** user selects a location and enters quantity to remove, **Then** system validates quantity against available stock
3. **Given** user enters valid quantity and optional comments, **When** user confirms removal, **Then** system reduces stock at that location and updates total quantity
4. **Given** user removes all stock from a location, **When** removal is confirmed, **Then** system removes the stock entry entirely
5. **Given** multiple component rows have remove stock forms open, **When** user submits a form, **Then** system applies the removal only to the component associated with that specific row

**Move Stock**
1. **Given** a component row is expanded and has stock in multiple locations, **When** user selects "Move Stock" from the row expansion menu, **Then** system displays a form inline within the expanded row with source location pre-selected (current row's location)
2. **Given** move stock form is open in the expanded row, **When** user views destination options, **Then** system shows existing locations that already contain this component and option for "Other locations that can accept this part"
3. **Given** user selects an existing location as destination, **When** user enters quantity to move, **Then** system validates quantity against source location's available stock
4. **Given** user selects "Other locations" option, **When** user chooses or creates a new location, **Then** system allows moving stock to a location that doesn't currently have this component
5. **Given** user enters valid move parameters and optional comments, **When** user confirms move, **Then** system transfers stock from source to destination location atomically
6. **Given** user moves all stock from a location, **When** move is confirmed, **Then** system removes the source stock entry and creates/updates destination entry
7. **Given** multiple component rows have move stock forms open, **When** user submits a form, **Then** system applies the move operation only to the component associated with that specific row

### Edge Cases
- What happens when user tries to move stock but selects the same source and destination location?
- How does system handle validation errors during multi-step add stock workflow?
- What happens when an admin attempts to modify stock while another admin has the location locked?
