# Tasks: Docker and User Documentation

**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/004-docker-and-user/`
**Prerequisites**: plan.md (complete), research.md (complete), quickstart.md (complete)

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Load plan.md from feature directory ✓
   → Documentation-only feature confirmed
   → Tech stack: Markdown, MkDocs, Docker
   → Structure: Web app with docs/ directory
2. Load optional design documents ✓
   → research.md: Docker infrastructure analysis complete
   → quickstart.md: 5-minute deployment guide created
   → No data-model.md (N/A for docs)
   → No contracts/ (N/A for docs)
3. Generate tasks by category ✓
   → Setup: Create docs/deployment/ directory
   → Validation: Docker command verification scripts
   → Core: Write 8 new/updated documentation files
   → Integration: MkDocs navigation and build
   → Polish: Link checking, consistency review
4. Apply task rules ✓
   → Different files = mark [P] for parallel
   → Validation scripts before writing
   → Core deployment docs before user guides
5. Number tasks sequentially (T001-T024)
6. Generate specialized agent recommendations
7. Validate task completeness ✓
8. Return: SUCCESS (24 tasks ready for execution)
```

## Specialized Agent Recommendations

Based on the user's request to identify best specialized agents for tasks:

- **docs agent**: Primary agent for all documentation writing tasks (T009-T020)
  - Expert in creating clear, well-structured documentation
  - Follows MkDocs conventions and markdown best practices
  - Ensures consistency across documentation files

- **general-purpose agent**: For setup, validation, and integration tasks (T001-T008, T021-T024)
  - Handles file system operations
  - Runs validation scripts
  - Updates configuration files

## Format: `[ID] [P?] Description [Agent]`
- **[P]**: Can run in parallel (different files, no dependencies)
- **[Agent]**: Recommended specialized agent for the task
- Include exact file paths in descriptions

## Phase 3.1: Setup & Validation Scripts
**Agent: general-purpose**

- [x] T001 Create docs/deployment/ directory structure at /Users/seaton/Documents/src/partshub/docs/deployment/
- [x] T002 [P] Create validation script for Docker commands at /Users/seaton/Documents/src/partshub/specs/004-docker-and-user/validate-docker.sh [general-purpose]
- [x] T003 [P] Create validation script for environment variables at /Users/seaton/Documents/src/partshub/specs/004-docker-and-user/validate-env.sh [general-purpose]

## Phase 3.2: Validation Scripts (TDD for Documentation)
**CRITICAL: These validation scripts MUST be created and run (expecting failures) before writing documentation**

**Constitutional Requirements (Adapted for Documentation)**:
- **Principle II (TDD)**: Validation scripts written before documentation
- **Principle VI (Test Isolation)**: Each validation script is independent and parallelizable

- [x] T004 [P] Validation: Docker run command test in specs/004-docker-and-user/validate-docker.sh [general-purpose]
- [x] T005 [P] Validation: Docker Compose up test in specs/004-docker-and-user/validate-compose.sh [general-purpose]
- [x] T006 [P] Validation: Volume mount test in specs/004-docker-and-user/validate-volumes.sh [general-purpose]
- [x] T007 [P] Validation: Environment variable completeness in specs/004-docker-and-user/validate-env-complete.sh [general-purpose]

## Dependencies

**Setup → Validation → Writing → Integration → Polish**

- T001 (directory creation) blocks T009-T018
- T002-T003 (validation script setup) blocks T004-T007
- T004-T008 (validation) should complete before T009-T018 (writing)
- T009 (main docker.md) recommended before T012-T014 (advanced topics)
- T009-T018 (all docs) block T019 (navigation)
- T019 (navigation) blocks T020 (build test)
- T009-T018 (docs written) block T021-T023 (validation and review)
- T021-T023 (validation and review) block T024 (final build)

## Parallel Execution Examples

### Phase 3.1: Setup (Sequential)
```bash
# T001 - Create directory structure first
mkdir -p /Users/seaton/Documents/src/partshub/docs/deployment

# Then T002 and T003 in parallel
# Create validation scripts (different files)
```

### Phase 3.2: Validation Scripts (All Parallel)
```bash
# T004-T007 can all be created in parallel (different files)
# Use docs agent for all:
Task: "Create Docker run validation script at specs/004-docker-and-user/validate-docker.sh"
Task: "Create Docker Compose validation script at specs/004-docker-and-user/validate-compose.sh"
Task: "Create volume mount validation script at specs/004-docker-and-user/validate-volumes.sh"
Task: "Create env var validation script at specs/004-docker-and-user/validate-env-complete.sh"
```

### Phase 3.3: Core Documentation (Mostly Parallel)
```bash
# T009-T011 can run in parallel (different files, foundational docs)
# Use docs agent for all:
Task: "Write docs/deployment/docker.md with comprehensive Docker deployment guide"
Task: "Write docs/deployment/environment.md with environment variable reference"
Task: "Write docs/deployment/volumes.md with data persistence guide"

# T012-T014 can run in parallel (different files, advanced topics)
Task: "Write docs/deployment/docker-compose.md with Docker Compose usage guide"
Task: "Write docs/deployment/backup.md with backup and recovery procedures"
Task: "Write docs/deployment/production.md with production deployment recommendations"
```

### Phase 3.4: User Documentation (Mostly Parallel)
```bash
# T015-T016 can run in parallel (different files)
# Use docs agent for all:
Task: "Write docs/user/features.md with complete feature guide"
Task: "Write docs/user/docker-quickstart.md with quick Docker deployment"

# T017-T018 can run in parallel (different files, updates)
Task: "Update docs/user/index.md to add full feature overview"
Task: "Update docs/user/getting-started.md to add Docker quick reference"
```

### Phase 3.6: Polish (Some Parallel)
```bash
# T021-T022 can run in parallel (independent validation)
Task: "Run validation scripts against written documentation"
Task: "Perform link validation and consistency check"

# T023 then T024 (sequential - review before final build)
```

## Notes
- **[P]** tasks = different files, no dependencies
- **docs agent** is primary agent for all documentation writing (T009-T018, T023)
- **general-purpose agent** handles setup, validation, integration (T001-T008, T019-T022, T024)
- Validation scripts act as "tests" for documentation (TDD for docs)
- Commit after each major documentation file completed
- Focus on clarity, examples, and troubleshooting

## Task Generation Rules Applied

1. **From Research.md**:
   - Docker architecture → docker.md (T009)
   - Environment variables inventory → environment.md (T010)
   - Data persistence analysis → volumes.md (T011)
   - CI/CD workflows → production.md (T014)

2. **From Plan.md Outlines**:
   - Each outlined doc file → writing task [P]
   - 8 new/updated files → T009-T018
   - MkDocs integration → T019-T020

3. **From Quickstart.md**:
   - Quick deployment scenarios → docker-quickstart.md (T016)
   - Validation examples → validation scripts (T004-T007)

4. **Ordering**:
   - Setup → Validation → Core Docs → User Docs → Integration → Polish
   - Foundation docs (docker.md) before advanced topics
   - All writing before integration/review
