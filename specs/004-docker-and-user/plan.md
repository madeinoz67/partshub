## Summary

Create comprehensive Docker deployment documentation and expand user guides for PartsHub. The feature focuses on documenting the existing all-in-one Docker image, including deployment instructions, environment configuration, data persistence, backup/recovery procedures, and expanded user documentation covering all application features.

**Primary Requirements**:
- Document all-in-one Docker image architecture (backend + frontend in single container)
- Provide Docker Compose example for development
- Document environment variables, volume mounts, and networking
- Create backup and recovery documentation
- Expand user guides to cover all major features
- Include production deployment recommendations with example configurations
- Document security considerations with best practices

**Technical Approach**: This is a documentation-only feature that will create/update Markdown files in the `docs/` directory. No code changes required. Documentation will cover existing Docker infrastructure defined in `Dockerfile`, `docker-compose.yml`, and GitHub Actions workflows.

## Technical Context

**Language/Version**: Markdown, MkDocs (Python 3.11 for docs server)
**Primary Dependencies**: MkDocs, Docker, existing PartsHub infrastructure
**Storage**: N/A - Documentation files only
**Testing**: Documentation validation, link checking, example command verification
**Target Platform**: MkDocs site hosted on GitHub Pages
**Project Type**: web - Documentation for web application with backend + frontend
**Performance Goals**: Documentation site loads in <2 seconds, examples execute successfully
**Constraints**: Keep documentation clear and concise, follow existing MkDocs structure
**Scale/Scope**: ~10-15 new/updated documentation files covering Docker deployment and user guides

## Constitution Check
*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

**Structure Decision**: Web application with MkDocs documentation. New documentation files will be created in `docs/deployment/` directory for Docker-specific content and `docs/user/` for expanded user guides. Follows existing MkDocs structure with YAML navigation updates.

## Phase 0: Outline & Research

### Research Tasks

1. **Docker Infrastructure Inventory**:
   - Task: Analyze existing Dockerfile multi-stage build structure
   - Task: Review docker-compose.yml configuration
   - Task: Document GitHub Actions Docker publishing workflows (CD and Release)
   - Task: Identify all environment variables used across Docker files
   - Task: Map volume mount points and data directory structure

2. **Documentation Structure Research**:
   - Task: Review existing MkDocs structure and navigation patterns
   - Task: Identify documentation gaps in current user guides
   - Task: Research best practices for Docker documentation organization
   - Task: Review MkDocs Material theme features for code examples

3. **Existing Content Analysis**:
   - Task: Catalog current Docker-related documentation in README.md
   - Task: Review existing getting-started.md for Docker content
   - Task: Identify reusable content vs. new content needed

### Consolidation Strategy

Create `research.md` with:
- **Docker Architecture**: Summary of all-in-one image, multi-stage build, entrypoint script
- **Environment Variables**: Complete inventory from Dockerfile and docker-compose.yml
- **Data Persistence**: Analysis of /app/data directory structure and volume requirements
- **Documentation Gaps**: List of missing topics vs. functional requirements
- **Content Organization**: Proposed structure for deployment/ and user/ directories

**Output**: research.md with complete inventory of existing infrastructure and documentation plan

## Phase 1: Design & Contracts

*Prerequisites: research.md complete*

### 1. Data Model
**N/A for documentation feature** - No entities, only content structure

### 2. API Contracts
**N/A for documentation feature** - No API changes

### 3. Contract Tests
**Validation Scripts Instead**:
- Create validation scripts to verify Docker commands work
- Test that example commands in documentation execute successfully
- Validate environment variable examples are complete
- Verify volume mount examples work on different platforms

### 4. Documentation Outline (replaces contract tests)

Generate detailed outlines for each new documentation file:

**docs/deployment/docker.md**:
- Introduction to PartsHub Docker image
- All-in-one architecture explanation
- Quick start with docker run commands
- Port configuration (8000, 3000)
- Health check configuration
- Troubleshooting common issues

**docs/deployment/docker-compose.md**:
- Introduction to Docker Compose for PartsHub
- Development compose file walkthrough
- Starting and stopping services
- Viewing logs
- Common compose commands

**docs/deployment/environment.md**:
- DATABASE_URL configuration
- PORT and FRONTEND_PORT settings
- ENVIRONMENT flag (development/production)
- SEED_DB for test data
- Complete environment variable reference table

**docs/deployment/volumes.md**:
- Purpose of /app/data directory

- Data directory structure (database, attachments)
- Permissions and ownership considerations
- Platform-specific volume mounting

**docs/deployment/backup.md**:
- What to backup (data directory contents)
- Backup frequency recommendations
- Basic backup procedures
- Recovery procedures
- Version compatibility notes

**docs/deployment/production.md**:
- Production deployment recommendations
- Environment variable configuration examples
- Volume mount security practices
- Network isolation recommendations
- Upgrade procedures

**docs/user/features.md**:
- Component management overview
- Storage location layout generator
- Search and filtering capabilities
- API access and tokens
- Authentication and access levels

**docs/user/docker-quickstart.md**:
- Fastest path to running PartsHub with Docker
- Single-command deployment
- Accessing the application
- First login procedures
- Next steps

### 5. Quickstart Guide

Create `quickstart.md` with:
- Prerequisites (Docker installed)
- Single command to run PartsHub
- How to access the application
- How to find admin credentials
- How to verify deployment succeeded

### 6. Update CLAUDE.md

Run incremental update script:
```bash
.specify/scripts/bash/update-agent-context.sh claude
```

Add to Active Technologies:
- MkDocs with Material theme (documentation)

Add to Recent Changes:
- 004-docker-and-user: Comprehensive Docker deployment documentation and expanded user guides

**Output**: Detailed documentation outlines, quickstart.md, updated CLAUDE.md

## Phase 2: Task Planning Approach
*This section describes what the /tasks command will do - DO NOT execute during /plan*

**Task Generation Strategy**:
- Load `.specify/templates/tasks-template.md` as base
- Generate tasks from Phase 1 documentation outlines
- Each documentation file → research + outline + write + review task sequence
- Validation scripts → separate testing tasks
- MkDocs configuration → integration task

**Task Categories**:
1. **Research Phase** (from Phase 0 research.md)
   - Inventory existing Docker infrastructure
   - Analyze current documentation gaps
   - Research documentation best practices

2. **Documentation Writing** (from Phase 1 outlines)
   - Each new .md file → write task
   - Each updated .md file → update task
   - MkDocs navigation update → configuration task

3. **Validation** (from Phase 1 validation scripts)
   - Docker command validation
   - Link checking
   - Example verification
   - MkDocs build test

4. **Review and Polish**
   - Documentation review task
   - Consistency check
   - Final build and deployment test

**Ordering Strategy**:
- Research tasks first (build context)
- Docker deployment docs before user guides (foundation first)
- Core deployment guides before advanced topics (docker.md before production.md)
- Validation tasks after each documentation section
- Mark [P] for parallel documentation writing (independent files)

**Estimated Output**: 20-25 numbered, ordered tasks in tasks.md

**IMPORTANT**: This phase is executed by the /tasks command, NOT by /plan

## Phase 3+: Future Implementation
*These phases are beyond the scope of the /plan command*

**Phase 3**: Task execution (/tasks command creates tasks.md)
**Phase 4**: Implementation (write documentation following task order)
**Phase 5**: Validation (verify Docker commands, test documentation site, review completeness)

## Complexity Tracking
*No constitutional violations - documentation-only feature*

No complexity deviations. This feature aligns with all constitutional principles, particularly Principle VII (Documentation Review) which this feature directly addresses.
