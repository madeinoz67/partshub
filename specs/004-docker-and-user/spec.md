# Feature Specification: Docker and User Documentation

**Feature Branch**: `004-docker-and-user`
**Created**: 2025-10-04
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "docker and user documentation; need to document the docker image and provide more detailed user documentation, use specialized agents as needed"

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí Feature involves documenting existing Docker infrastructure and expanding user guides
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Actors: End users, DevOps engineers, contributors
   ‚Üí Actions: Deploy via Docker, access application, configure environment
   ‚Üí Data: Docker images, environment variables, volume mounts, network configuration
   ‚Üí Constraints: Documentation must be accurate, complete, and accessible
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí [RESOLVED: Docker Compose for development only]
   ‚Üí [RESOLVED: Production deployment guidance at intermediate level with examples]
   ‚Üí [RESOLVED: Security considerations with recommended practices and examples]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí Defined below with clear user flows
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí All requirements are testable and measurable
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
   ‚Üí Documentation files, Docker images, configuration examples
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí Some clarifications needed but core spec is complete
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning with minor clarifications)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

---

## Clarifications

### Session 2025-10-04
- Q: Docker Compose configuration scope - Which deployment scenarios should be covered? ‚Üí A: Development only - single service with basic setup for local development
- Q: Production deployment guidance depth - How detailed should production guidance be? ‚Üí A: Intermediate - Production recommendations with example configurations but users handle detailed implementation
- Q: Backup verification and testing - Should documentation include backup validation guidance? ‚Üí A: Basic backup instructions only - document what to back up and how often

## User Scenarios & Testing

### Primary User Story
As a new PartsHub user, I want comprehensive documentation on deploying the application using Docker so that I can quickly get the system running in my environment without extensive troubleshooting. As a DevOps engineer, I need detailed information about Docker image architecture, environment configuration, and production deployment considerations so I can properly deploy and maintain PartsHub in production environments.

### Acceptance Scenarios

1. **Given** a user has Docker installed on their system, **When** they access the Docker deployment documentation, **Then** they can successfully run PartsHub using the provided Docker commands within 10 minutes

2. **Given** a user wants to understand the Docker image structure, **When** they read the Docker documentation, **Then** they can identify the all-in-one application image that runs both backend and frontend services

3. **Given** a DevOps engineer needs to deploy PartsHub to production, **When** they follow the Docker deployment guide, **Then** they can configure persistent storage, environment variables, and networking correctly

4. **Given** a user encounters a Docker deployment issue, **When** they consult the troubleshooting section, **Then** they can find solutions to common problems like port conflicts, volume permissions, and image pulling errors

5. **Given** a user wants to customize their Docker deployment, **When** they review the environment variable documentation, **Then** they can identify all available configuration options and their default values

6. **Given** a new user wants to understand the full application capabilities, **When** they read the user documentation, **Then** they can discover all features including component management, storage location generation, API access, and authentication

7. **Given** a user wants to persist data outside the container, **When** they follow the volume mount documentation, **Then** they can successfully map the data directory to their local filesystem and access the database and attachments directly

8. **Given** a user needs to backup their PartsHub installation, **When** they follow the backup documentation, **Then** they can identify all necessary files and create a complete backup that can be restored to a new container

9. **Given** a user experiences data loss or corruption, **When** they follow the recovery procedures, **Then** they can restore their PartsHub data from a backup and resume operations

### Edge Cases
- What happens when Docker volumes have incorrect permissions?
- How does the system handle database migrations in Docker containers on first startup?
- What occurs if the backend starts before the database is ready?
- How can users debug container-specific issues versus application issues?
- What happens when users need to upgrade from one Docker image version to another?
- How does authentication work in containerized deployments with multiple instances?
- What happens if a user tries to restore a backup from a different version of PartsHub?
- How should users handle data directory permissions when switching between different host operating systems?
- What occurs if the data directory becomes corrupted or inaccessible while the container is running?
- What happens when the data directory fills up the host filesystem?

## Requirements
