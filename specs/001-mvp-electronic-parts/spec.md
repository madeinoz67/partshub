# Feature Specification: MVP Electronic Parts Management Application

**Feature Branch**: `001-mvp-electronic-parts`
**Created**: 2025-09-25
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "mvp electronic parts management application, mimicking https://partsbox.io infunctionality"

## User Scenarios & Testing

### Primary User Story

As an electronics hobbyist or engineer, I need to track my electronic component inventory so I can quickly find parts for projects, avoid duplicate purchases, and maintain an organized workspace. I want to scan barcodes, search by specifications, track quantities, and see where components are physically stored.

### Acceptance Scenarios

1. **Given** I have a new electronic component, **When** I scan its barcode or manually enter details, **Then** the part is added to my inventory with specifications, quantity, and storage location
2. **Given** I'm working on a project, **When** I search for "capacitor 100uF 25V", **Then** I see all matching components in my inventory with quantities and locations
3. **Given** I use a component for a project, **When** I update the quantity, **Then** the inventory reflects the new count and alerts me when stock is low
4. **Given** I have components in different storage locations, **When** I view a component, **Then** I can see exactly which box/drawer/shelf it's stored in
5. **Given** I want to order more components, **When** I generate a shopping list, **Then** I see parts that are low in stock with supplier information

### Edge Cases

- What happens when scanning a barcode that doesn't exist in the parts database?
- How does the system handle duplicate part entries with slightly different specifications?
- What occurs when trying to subtract more quantity than available in stock?
- How does the system behave when storage locations are reorganized or renamed?
