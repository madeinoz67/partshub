# Technical Research: MVP Electronic Parts Management Application

## Research Overview

This document resolves technical unknowns from the planning phase and establishes the technology stack and architectural decisions for the PartsHub inventory management system.

## Technology Stack Decisions

### Language/Version Selection
**Decision**: Python 3.11+
**Rationale**:
- Excellent ecosystem for web development (FastAPI, Flask)
- Strong libraries for barcode processing (pyzbar), data manipulation (pandas), and database integration
- Good community support for electronics/engineering applications
- Cross-platform compatibility for self-contained deployment
- Easy integration with external APIs (LCSC, Octopart)

**Alternatives considered**:
- Node.js/TypeScript: Good for real-time features but fewer electronics-specific libraries
- Rust: Excellent performance but steeper learning curve and smaller ecosystem
- Go: Good for APIs but limited frontend ecosystem

### Web Framework
**Decision**: FastAPI with SQLAlchemy
**Rationale**:
- Native OpenAPI/Swagger documentation generation (important for KiCad integration)
- Excellent type hints and validation with Pydantic
- High performance async capabilities
- Built-in JWT authentication support
- Strong ecosystem for background tasks (Celery integration)

**Alternatives considered**:
- Flask: Simpler but requires more manual setup for API documentation
- Django: Full-featured but heavyweight for this use case
- Express.js: Would require TypeScript/JavaScript instead of Python

### Database Selection
**Decision**: SQLite with JSON fields and FTS5 full-text search
**Rationale**:
- Single-file database perfect for self-contained standalone application
- JSON fields handle varying component specifications elegantly (resistors vs ICs have different parameters)
- Built-in full-text search (FTS5 extension) for fast component discovery across 10k+ parts
- Zero configuration and maintenance overhead for end users
- Excellent Python integration with SQLAlchemy ORM
- ACID compliance ensures data integrity for inventory operations
- Simple backup/restore (copy single .db file)
- No separate database server process required

**Hybrid Schema Approach**:
- Structured fields (quantities, relationships, transactions) use SQL columns for integrity
- Component specifications stored as JSON for flexibility (voltage, current, package details)
- Custom user fields stored as JSON for extensibility
- Full-text search indexes both SQL and JSON content

**Alternatives considered**:
- PostgreSQL: More powerful but heavyweight for single-user application, requires separate server
- TinyDB: Pure Python but poor performance at scale and limited query capabilities
- MongoDB: Excellent document handling but overkill for hobbyist inventory management

### Frontend Framework
**Decision**: Vue.js 3 with Quasar Framework
**Rationale**:
- Component-based architecture suitable for inventory management UI
- Quasar provides professional UI components out of the box
- Good barcode scanning support through browser APIs
- Easy integration with FastAPI backend
- Responsive design for desktop-first with mobile compatibility

**Alternatives considered**:
- React: Popular but more complex state management
- Angular: Full-featured but heavyweight for single-user application
- Vanilla JavaScript: Too much manual work for complex UI requirements

### Testing Framework
**Decision**: pytest + Playwright for integration testing
**Rationale**:
- pytest is Python standard with excellent fixture support
- Playwright enables end-to-end testing of barcode scanning workflows
- Good integration with FastAPI test client
- Support for contract testing with API schemas

**Alternatives considered**:
- unittest: Python standard but less flexible than pytest
- Selenium: Older web testing framework, Playwright is more modern

## Integration Architecture

### Component Data Providers
**Decision**: Plugin architecture with abstract base class
**Rationale**:
- Extensible design allows adding new providers (LCSC, Octopart, Mouser, DigiKey)
- Each provider implements standard interface: search, get_details, get_datasheet
- Async operations prevent UI blocking during data retrieval
- Caching layer reduces API calls and improves performance

**Implementation approach**:
```python
class ComponentDataProvider(ABC):
    @abstractmethod
    async def search_component(self, query: str) -> List[ComponentResult]

    @abstractmethod
    async def get_component_details(self, part_id: str) -> ComponentDetails

    @abstractmethod
    async def get_datasheet_url(self, part_id: str) -> Optional[str]
```

### Barcode Processing
**Decision**: pyzbar + OpenCV for barcode detection
**Rationale**:
- pyzbar handles multiple barcode formats (QR, Code128, etc.)
- OpenCV provides image processing for poor quality scans
- Browser-based scanning using device camera
- Fallback manual entry for unreadable codes

### KiCad Integration
**Decision**: RESTful API endpoints with KiCad-specific schemas
**Rationale**:
- Standard HTTP API allows KiCad plugins to query inventory
- JSON responses with symbol/footprint/3D model references
- Separate endpoints for library synchronization
- Version-controlled component library export

**API endpoints**:
- `GET /api/kicad/components` - Search components for KiCad
- `GET /api/kicad/component/{id}/symbol` - Get KiCad symbol data
- `GET /api/kicad/libraries/sync` - Synchronize component libraries

## Architecture Decisions

### Authentication Strategy
**Decision**: Tiered authentication with JWT tokens
**Rationale**:
- Anonymous read access for searching/viewing aligns with hobbyist workflow
- JWT tokens for web admin operations provide security without session complexity
- API tokens for programmatic access enable KiCad integration
- Default admin user with forced password change ensures security

### Storage Architecture
**Decision**: Hierarchical location model with grid generation
**Rationale**:
- Tree structure supports cabinet > shelf > box organization
- Bulk location creation with naming patterns (box1-a1, box1-a2, etc.)
- Immutable locations prevent data integrity issues
- Single-component restrictions available for precise organization

### Performance Optimization
**Decision**: PostgreSQL full-text search with component indexing
**Rationale**:
- Full-text search across all component fields <1 second for 10,000 components
- Indexed search on specifications (voltage, resistance, package)
- Cached aggregation for dashboard statistics
- Lazy loading for component images and datasheets

## Development Environment

### Deployment Strategy
**Decision**: Docker container with embedded SQLite database
**Rationale**:
- Single container deployment with no external dependencies
- SQLite database file stored in mounted volume for persistence
- Backup = copy single .db file
- Minimal system requirements (Docker + browser)
- Optional standalone Python deployment for advanced users
- Zero database administration or maintenance

### Development Tools
- **Package Management**: uv for fast Python dependency management and virtual environments
- **Linting**: ruff for Python, ESLint for JavaScript
- **Formatting**: black for Python, prettier for JavaScript
- **Type checking**: mypy for Python, TypeScript for frontend
- **API documentation**: FastAPI auto-generated OpenAPI docs
- **Database migrations**: Alembic with SQLAlchemy

## Performance Targets

### Response Time Goals
- Component search: <500ms for any query across 10,000 components
- UI interactions: <200ms for standard CRUD operations
- Barcode scanning: <2 seconds from capture to component identification
- Dashboard loading: <1 second for statistics calculation

### Scalability Considerations
- Current architecture supports 10,000 components efficiently
- Database design allows scaling to 100,000+ components with indexing
- Async FastAPI design supports concurrent users when needed
- Plugin architecture enables enterprise provider integrations

## Security Considerations

### Data Protection
- Component data encrypted at rest (PostgreSQL encryption)
- JWT tokens with reasonable expiration times
- API rate limiting to prevent abuse
- Input validation and SQL injection prevention

### Deployment Security
- Default admin password must be changed on first use
- API tokens can be revoked and regenerated
- Docker container runs with non-root user
- Database accessible only within container network

## Conclusion

This technology stack provides a solid foundation for the MVP electronic parts management application while maintaining extensibility for future enhancements. The combination of Python/FastAPI backend with Vue.js/Quasar frontend offers rapid development capabilities with professional results.
