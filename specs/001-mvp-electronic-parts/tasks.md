## Dependencies

### Critical Path Dependencies
- Setup (T001-T007) must complete before all other phases
- Contract tests (T008-T025) must fail before models and implementation
- Models (T026-T042) must complete before services (T043-T050)
- Services must complete before API endpoints (T051-T068)
- Backend APIs must be working before frontend integration

### Parallel Execution Opportunities

Task: "Dashboard component with statistics cards in frontend/src/components/Dashboard.vue"
```

## Notes
- [P] tasks can run simultaneously as they work on different files
- Contract tests MUST fail before proceeding to implementation
- SQLite database allows single-file deployment and backup
- JSON fields in Component model support flexible specifications per component type
- Frontend uses Quasar Framework for professional UI components
- All external integrations (LCSC, KiCad) use plugin architecture for extensibility
