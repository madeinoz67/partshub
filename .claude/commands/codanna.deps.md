## Dependency Analysis Workflow

**TargetSymbol**: "$ARGUMENTS"

### My Analysis Approach

Claude, I need to understand the dependency structure of this symbol. Here's my workflow:

1. **First, verify the symbol exists** - Get complete information about what we're analyzing
2. **Map direct dependencies** - What does this symbol depend on (calls it makes)?
3. **Map reverse dependencies** - What depends on this symbol (who calls it)?
4. **Check for implementations** - If it's a trait/interface, who implements it?
5. **Synthesize insights** - Analyze coupling, stability, and refactoring opportunities
6. **Generating Report** - Save the complete analysis report as a markdown file at @reports/deps/"$ARGUMENTS"-dependencies.md

---

### Step 0: Preparation

_"The user asked about '$ARGUMENTS'. I need to replace {TargetSymbol} with '$ARGUMENTS' in all the commands below."_

For example, if the user typed `/deps OutputManager`, then:
- Replace `{TargetSymbol}` with `OutputManager` in every command
- The actual command becomes: `codanna retrieve describe OutputManager --json`

### Step 1: Symbol Verification

_"Let me first check if this symbol exists and understand what it is..."_

```bash
codanna retrieve describe {TargetSymbol} --json | jq -r 'if .status == "success" then 
  "Symbol: \(.item.symbol.name) (\(.item.symbol.kind))\nLocation: \(.item.file_path)\nModule: \(.item.symbol.module_path)\nVisibility: \(.item.symbol.visibility)\n\nDocumentation:\n\(.item.symbol.doc_comment // "No documentation")\n\nSignature:\n\(.item.symbol.signature)"
else
  "Symbol not found: {TargetSymbol}"
end'
```

If the symbol doesn't exist, stop here and inform the user.

### Step 2: Direct Dependencies Analysis

_"Now I'll see what this symbol depends on (what it calls)..."_

```bash
codanna retrieve calls {TargetSymbol} --json | jq -r 'if .status == "success" then
  "Direct dependencies (\(.count) total):\n" + 
  (.items[:10] | map("  - \(.symbol.name) (\(.symbol.kind)) at \(.file_path)") | join("\n"))
else
  "No direct dependencies found (may not be a callable symbol)"
end'
```

### Step 3: Reverse Dependencies Analysis

_"Let me check what depends on this symbol (who calls it)..."_

```bash
codanna retrieve callers {TargetSymbol} --json | jq -r 'if .status == "success" then
  "Reverse dependencies (\(.count) callers):\n" + 
  (.items[:10] | map("  - \(.symbol.name) (\(.symbol.kind)) at \(.file_path)") | join("\n"))
else
  "No callers found (may be an entry point or unused)"
end'
```

### Step 4: Implementation Check (if applicable)

_"If this is a trait or interface, let me find its implementations..."_

```bash
codanna retrieve implementations {TargetSymbol} --json | jq -r 'if .status == "success" then
  "Implementations (\(.count) total):\n" + 
  (.items | map("  - \(.symbol.name) at \(.file_path)") | join("\n"))
else
  "No implementations (not a trait/interface or no implementors)"
end'
```

Note: This returning "not found" is expected for non-traits.

### Step 5: Deep Code Analysis (Important!)

_"Let me examine the actual implementation of key methods to understand the real dependencies..."_

For structs with methods, get the file paths and line ranges:

```bash
codanna retrieve describe {TargetSymbol} --json | jq -r 'if .item.relationships.defines then
  "Key methods to examine:\n" + 
  (.item.relationships.defines[:3] | map("  - \(.name) at \(.file_path // "src/unknown.rs"):\(.range.start_line)-\(.range.end_line + 10)") | join("\n"))
else
  "No methods to examine"
end'
```

**Claude: Based on the line ranges above, READ THE ACTUAL CODE of 2-3 key methods:**
- For example, for constructors (`new`, `with_*`): Read to understand what dependencies are injected
- For main public methods: Read to see what they actually call internally
- Look for: field initialization, method calls, trait usage, error handling patterns

Example action you should take:
```
If you see "new at src/indexing/simple.rs:100-150", then:
Use the Read tool: Read(file_path="src/indexing/simple.rs", offset=100, limit=50)
```

This code reading is **CRUCIAL** for understanding actual dependencies that `retrieve calls` might miss!

### Step 6: Caller Context Analysis

_"For the top callers, let me see HOW they actually use this symbol..."_

```bash
codanna retrieve callers {TargetSymbol} --json | jq -r 'if .status == "success" and .count > 0 then
  "Top caller contexts to examine:\n" + 
  (.items[:10] | map("  - \(.symbol.name) at \(.file_path):\(.symbol.range.start_line)-\(.symbol.range.end_line + 5)") | join("\n"))
else
  "No callers to examine"
end'
```

**Claude: READ 1-2 of the top callers to understand usage patterns:**
- How is this symbol instantiated or called?
- What parameters/config are passed?
- What's done with the return value?
- Are there patterns of usage across callers?

# Dependency Analysis Report: {Descriptive Title}

**TargetSymbol**: "$ARGUMENTS"
**Generated**: !`date '+%B %d, %Y at %I:%M %p'`

## Summary

Brief overview of what was discovered and the main purpose of the search.

## Key Findings
After running the commands above, provide a comprehensive analysis:

## Dependency Structure for {SYMBOL}

### Overview
Based on the JSON data retrieved:
- **Symbol Type**: [Extract from kind field]
- **Location**: [Extract from file_path]
- **Purpose**: [Extract from doc_comment]
- **Visibility**: [Extract from visibility field]

### Dependency Metrics
From the JSON counts:
- **Direct Dependencies**: [count from calls] symbols this depends on
- **Reverse Dependencies**: [count from callers] symbols that depend on this
- **Coupling Level**: 
  - 0-5 dependencies each way = Low coupling
  - 6-15 dependencies each way = Medium coupling
  - 16+ dependencies each way = High coupling

### Key Findings

1. **Stability Assessment**
   - Many callers + few calls = Stable foundation (good for interfaces)
   - Few callers + many calls = Unstable/volatile (refactor candidate)
   - High both ways = Central hub (refactor carefully)

2. **Impact Analysis**
   Look at the actual callers list and identify:
   - Test vs production code (files containing "test" vs others)
   - Critical paths (main functions, API handlers)
   - Module boundaries crossed

3. **Coupling Patterns**
   From the dependency lists, identify:
   - Tightly coupled clusters (multiple symbols from same module)
   - Cross-module dependencies (different module_path values)
   - Circular dependencies (if A calls B and B appears in A's callers)

### Refactoring Recommendations

Based on the dependency patterns observed:

1. **Decoupling Opportunities**
   - If many dependencies are from one module, consider dependency injection
   - If crossing many module boundaries, consider a facade pattern

2. **Interface Segregation**
   - If this has 10+ methods (for structs), consider splitting
   - If callers only use subset of functionality, create focused interfaces

3. **Testing Priority**
   - With X callers, changes need regression testing
   - Focus on testing the top 5 callers first

### Risk Assessment

- **Change Risk**: Based on caller count
  - 0-5 callers = Low risk
  - 6-20 callers = Medium risk  
  - 20+ callers = High risk
  
- **Complexity Risk**: Based on dependency count
  - 0-10 dependencies = Low complexity
  - 11-30 dependencies = Medium complexity
  - 30+ dependencies = High complexity

**Recommended Action**: [Synthesize based on both risks]

**Instructions for Claude**:
1. Execute each command in sequence, replacing {TargetSymbol} with the actual symbol name
2. Use the mental cues (in italics) to guide your thinking
3. The JSON output is processed by jq to show readable summaries
4. Interpret the actual numbers and patterns from the JSON data
5. Provide actionable insights based on the real dependency counts and patterns
6. Save the complete analysis report as a markdown file at `@reports/deps/{TargetSymbol}-[short-semantic-slug]-dependencies.md`
7. Include a "Dependency Graph" section with a Mermaid diagram showing:
   - The target symbol in the center
   - Direct dependencies (what it calls) with arrows pointing FROM the symbol
   - Reverse dependencies (what calls it) with arrows pointing TO the symbol
   - Use different colors/styles for different dependency types
