make clean         # Clean build artifacts
```

### Natural Language Search (Latest Feature!)

PartsHub now supports searching with conversational queries, making it faster and more intuitive to find components.

#### Quick Examples

Instead of setting multiple filters manually, just type:
- **"find resistors with low stock"** - Get all resistors below minimum stock level
- **"capacitors in location A1"** - Find all capacitors stored in bin A1
- **"10k SMD resistors"** - Search for 10kŒ© surface-mount resistors
- **"out of stock transistors"** - List transistors with zero quantity
- **"components under $5"** - Find budget-friendly parts

#### Key Features

- **Plain English queries** - No need to learn complex filter syntax
- **Multi-entity support** - Combine multiple criteria: "10k SMD resistors with low stock in A1"
- **Confidence scoring** - Visual feedback (green/orange/red) shows how well your query was understood
- **Smart fallback** - Automatically uses full-text search for ambiguous queries
- **Search history** - Access your 10 most recent natural language queries
- **Interactive filters** - Click to remove extracted filters and refine results

#### Supported Query Patterns

- **Component types**: resistors, capacitors, LEDs, ICs, transistors, connectors, etc.
- **Stock status**: low stock, out of stock, available, unused, need reorder
- **Locations**: in A1, at Bin-23, from Shelf-A, stored in Cabinet-1
- **Values**: 10k, 100ŒºF, 5V, 16MHz, 0805, DIP8
- **Price**: under $5, cheap, between $1 and $5, less than $10
- **Manufacturers**: Texas Instruments, Murata, Vishay, and more

#### API Example

```bash
# Natural language search via API
curl -X GET "http://localhost:8000/api/v1/components?nl_query=10k%20SMD%20resistors%20with%20low%20stock" \
  -H "accept: application/json"

# Response includes confidence and parsed entities
{
  "components": [...],
  "total": 5,
  "nl_metadata": {
    "query": "10k SMD resistors with low stock",
    "confidence": 0.92,
    "parsed_entities": {
      "component_type": "resistor",
      "resistance": "10kŒ©",
      "package": "SMD",
      "stock_status": "low"
    },
    "fallback_to_fts5": false,
    "intent": "search_by_type"
  }
}
```

### Component Creation Wizard (v0.4.0+)

PartsHub introduces a streamlined wizard interface for creating components, making it faster and easier to add new parts to your inventory.

#### Two-Step Workflow

1. **Basic Information**: Enter essential component details with smart autocomplete
2. **Resources (Optional)**: Link to provider data or add custom specifications

#### Key Features

- **Fuzzy Search Autocomplete**: Intelligent search for manufacturers and footprints
  - Real-time suggestions as you type
  - Case-insensitive matching with score-based ranking
  - Option to create new entries inline
- **Dual Creation Modes**:
  - **Linked Parts**: Connect to LCSC, Digi-Key, or Mouser for automatic datasheet fetching
  - **Local Parts**: Create standalone components without provider integration
- **Smart Component Types**: Autocomplete selection for component categories
- **Provider Integration**: Optional connection to supplier APIs for enriched data

#### API Example

```bash
# Create a component using the wizard (linked part)
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/v1/wizard/components \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <admin-token>" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "name": "10kŒ© Resistor",
    "component_type": "resistor",
    "manufacturer_name": "Yageo",
    "footprint": "0603",
    "category_id": "uuid",
    "storage_location_id": "uuid",
    "provider": "LCSC",
    "provider_sku": "C12345"
  }'

# Search for manufacturers with fuzzy matching
curl -X GET "http://localhost:8000/api/v1/wizard/manufacturers/search?q=yag&limit=10" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <admin-token>"
```

### Storage Location Layout Generation (v0.1.1)

PartsHub provides a powerful bulk storage location generation feature to quickly create systematic storage locations with advanced organizational capabilities.

#### Four Layout Types

1. **Single Layout**: Perfect for unique storage needs
2. **Row Layout (1D)**: Create linear sequences (e.g., `box1-a` through `box1-f`)
3. **Grid Layout (2D)**: Create 2D organizational grids (e.g., `drawer-a-1` to `drawer-f-5`)
4. **3D Grid Layout**: Generate multi-level hierarchical storage systems

#### Key Features

- **Real-time Preview**: See location names before creation
- **Bulk Creation**: Create up to 500 locations per batch
- **Flexible Naming**: Letter/number ranges, custom separators
- **Hierarchical Support**: Parent-child location relationships
- **Authentication-Gated**: Preview for all, creation for authenticated users

#### API Preview Example

Preview storage locations without creating them:

```bash
# Preview a row of bins from a-f
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/v1/storage-locations/generate-preview \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "layout_type": "row",
    "prefix": "box1-",
    "ranges": [{"range_type": "letters", "start": "a", "end": "f"}],
    "location_type": "bin"
  }'
```
