  - Bulk Import: (Future feature) Import multiple components via CSV or spreadsheet

#### 1.2 Editing Components
- Modify component details by clicking on an existing component
- Update fields such as:
  - Manufacturer
  - Part Number
  - Description
  - Stock Quantity
  - Storage Location
  - Additional Metadata

#### 1.3 Deleting Components
- Remove individual components from your inventory
- Confirmation dialog prevents accidental deletions
- Deletion logs maintained for inventory tracking

#### 1.4 Component Details

## 2. Storage Location Layout Generator

### Overview
The Storage Location Layout Generator helps you create a hierarchical and organized storage system for your electronic components.

### Features
- Create nested storage locations (e.g., Building > Room > Shelf > Bin)
- Visual representation of storage hierarchy
- Drag-and-drop organization
- QR code generation for quick location tracking

### Example Hierarchy
```
Electronics Lab
├── Main Storage
│   ├── Resistors Cabinet
│   │   ├── Top Drawer
│   │   │   ├── 1% Tolerance Resistors
│   │   │   └── 5% Tolerance Resistors
│   │   └── Bottom Drawer
│   │       ├── High Wattage Resistors
│   │       └── Specialty Resistors
├── Prototype Room
│   ├── Component Testing Area
│   └── Prototype Storage
```

### Use Cases
- Optimize physical inventory organization
- Streamline component retrieval
- Reduce time spent searching for parts

## 3. Search and Filtering Capabilities

### Advanced Search Features
- Powerful, multi-criteria search functionality
- Instant results as you type
- Supports complex query combinations

### Filter Options
- By Manufacturer
- By Component Type
- Stock Quantity Range
- Date Added/Modified
- Storage Location
- Custom Metadata Fields

### Sorting
- Sort results by multiple criteria
- Ascending/Descending order
- Save and share custom search configurations

### Examples
- Find all resistors with stock < 10
- List components added in the last 30 days
- Search for specific manufacturers or part numbers

## 4. Barcode Scanning Features

### Quick Component Updates
- Use mobile or desktop barcode scanner
- Instantly retrieve or update component information
- Supports multiple barcode formats (UPC, EAN, Code 128)

### Workflow
1. Scan barcode
2. Confirm or edit component details
3. Update stock quantity
4. Log transaction

### Integration
- Works with most standard barcode scanners
- Mobile app support (future roadmap)
- Minimal manual data entry

## 5. KiCad Integration Overview

### Purpose
Seamlessly transfer component data between PartsHub and KiCad for PCB design workflows.

### Key Features
- Export component libraries
- Generate symbol mappings
- Sync component metadata

### Workflow
1. Select components in PartsHub
2. Export to KiCad format
3. Import into KiCad schematic tool

**Detailed KiCad workflows available in [KiCad Workflows Guide](kicad-workflows.md)**

## 6. API Access and Token Management

### API Token Generation
- Available for Authenticated and Admin users
- Generate tokens with specific permissions
- Revoke or regenerate tokens as needed

### Token Types
- **Read-only:** View inventory data
- **Write:** Modify components and inventory
- **Admin:** Full system access

### Best Practices
- Rotate tokens periodically
- Use the most restrictive token possible
- Never share tokens publicly

## 7. Authentication and Access Levels

### User Tiers

#### Anonymous Users
- **Permissions:**
  - Browse components
  - Advanced search
  - View detailed specifications
  - Read-only access

#### Authenticated Users
- **All Anonymous Permissions, Plus:**
  - Create/Edit/Delete components
  - Manage stock quantities
  - Update storage locations
  - Generate API tokens

#### Admin Users
- **All Authenticated Permissions, Plus:**
  - API token management
  - User administration (future feature)
  - System-wide configuration

### Authentication Flow
1. Login with username/password
