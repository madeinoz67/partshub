# Release Notes for PartsHub v0.1.1

**Release Date**: October 4, 2025
**GitHub Release**: [v0.1.1](https://github.com/madeinoz67/partshub/releases/tag/v0.1.1)
**Comparison**: [v0.1.0...v0.1.1](https://github.com/madeinoz67/partshub/compare/v0.1.0...v0.1.1)

## Overview

PartsHub v0.1.1 introduces the **Storage Location Layout Generator**, a powerful feature enabling bulk creation of systematic storage locations with automated naming patterns. This release transforms how users organize their electronic parts inventory, allowing creation of up to 500 locations in seconds with four flexible layout types. Additionally, this release achieves 100% test pass rate, resolves all security vulnerabilities, and significantly improves CI/CD infrastructure.

## Major Features

### Storage Location Layout Generator (Phase 1 Complete)

The headline feature of v0.1.1 is the new bulk storage location generation system enabling rapid creation of organized storage hierarchies.

#### Four Layout Types

1. **Single Layout**
   - Create individual named locations
   - Perfect for unique storage needs

2. **Row Layout (1D)**
   - Generate linear sequences (e.g., `box1-a` through `box1-f`)
   - Ideal for shelf bins, drawer rows, or sequential containers

3. **Grid Layout (2D)**
   - Create 2D organizational grids (e.g., `drawer-a-1` to `drawer-f-5`)
   - Perfect for grid-style storage systems, PCB racks, or matrix layouts

4. **3D Grid Layout**
   - Generate multi-level hierarchical storage systems
   - Supports complex cabinet systems with shelves, rows, and columns
   - Full parent-child relationship support

#### Key Capabilities

- **Real-time Preview**: See the first 5 and last location names before creation
- **Bulk Creation**: Create up to 500 locations per batch with warnings at 100+
- **Flexible Naming**:
  - Letter ranges (a-z or A-Z) with capitalization options
  - Number ranges (1-999) with optional zero-padding (01, 02, etc.)
  - Custom separators and prefixes
- **Hierarchical Support**: Parent-child location relationships for nested organization
- **Single-Part Designation**: Mark locations for single-part storage only
- **Configuration Audit Trail**: Layout configurations stored as JSONB in database
- **Duplicate Prevention**: Transaction-safe validation prevents duplicate location names
- **Authentication-Gated**: Anonymous users can preview, authenticated users can create

#### API Endpoints

```bash
# Preview locations before creating (no authentication required)
POST /api/v1/storage-locations/generate-preview
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "layout_type": "row",
  "prefix": "box1-",
  "ranges": [{"range_type": "letters", "start": "a", "end": "f"}],
  "separators": [],
  "location_type": "bin"
}

# Response: 200 OK
{
  "sample_names": ["box1-a", "box1-b", "box1-c", "box1-d", "box1-e"],
  "total_count": 6,
  "validation": {
    "valid": true,
    "warnings": []
  }
}

# Bulk create locations (authentication required)
POST /api/v1/storage-locations/bulk-create-layout
Authorization: Bearer <token>
Content-Type: application/json

# Response: 201 Created
{
  "created_ids": [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6],
  "count": 6,
  "success": true
}

# Error responses:
# 409 Conflict - Duplicate location names
# 400 Bad Request - Location limit exceeded
# 404 Not Found - Invalid parent location
```

### Frontend Components

- **LocationLayoutDialog**: Main dialog with tabbed layout type selection
- **LayoutTypeTabs**: Tab navigation for 4 layout types
- **RangeConfigurator**: Dynamic range configuration based on layout
- **LocationPreview**: Preview with warnings/errors display
- **Responsive Storage Table**: Expandable rows for detailed location information

### Backend Services

## API Changes

### Consistency Updates

All storage location endpoints now use the `/api/v1/storage-locations` prefix for consistency.

**Before**: Mixed prefixes
**After**: `/api/v1/storage-locations/*`

The frontend has been automatically updated. If you're using the API directly, update your endpoints accordingly.

### New Endpoints

```
POST /api/v1/storage-locations/generate-preview
POST /api/v1/storage-locations/bulk-create-layout
```

## Breaking Changes

**None** - All changes are additive and backward compatible.

## Migration Instructions

### Database Migration Required

Run the database migration to add the new indexes and schema updates:

```bash
# Using Make (recommended)
make migrate

# OR manually
cd backend
DATABASE_URL="sqlite:///data/partshub.db" uv run alembic upgrade head
```

### API Endpoint Updates

If you're using the storage locations API directly, update your endpoints to use the `/api/v1/storage-locations` prefix. The frontend has been updated automatically.

### No Code Changes Required

All application code is backward compatible. Simply pull the latest changes and run migrations.
